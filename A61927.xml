            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SAid very pleaſantly one of the wits of this Age; and according to that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence I take my meaſures in this piece. I pretend not its defence to thoſe that diſlike it. If the reading ſeem tedious to them, they may let it alone and ſeek other wayes of diverſion. I freely confeſs that I have not put my ſelf on the rack in compoſing it. I write almoſt in the ſame way as one might ſpeak, without ſtudy or varniſh; and in a word, I have my ſelf been the firſt to whom the matters I treat of have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any recreation, and am certain that at leaſt the deſign of the inſuing ſtory ſhould not be unpleaſant in many places to thoſe who have any thing of a brisk and merry humour. There may be found perhaps in the
<pb facs="tcp:100358:3"/>management of the Romance, ſome kind of little punctilio's omitted. I may appear a bad Geographer in it, as to the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Precincts of <hi>Paris,</hi> and a worſe Chronologer as to the order of time. But in regard that is not the thing at which I aim'd; if the Hiſtories which I preſent be not tedious to the Reader, it will be no hard matter for me to perſwade him that theſe miſtakes are not altogether mine; but that I have been forced to alter ſome things in the ſeries of my work after the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was begun. If I be tedious to my Reader, it is needleſs to ask him pardon for that which is of leaſt importance in my undertaking. And take this for one part of what I intended to ſay.</p>
            <p>It remains now that I ſpeak to the new way of writing which may ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by me. There are but few before me who thought upon giving French names to their Hero's. And it is to be feared that ſome Romantick heads finding the name of a Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,
<pb facs="tcp:100358:3"/>Mireſtain, Franlieu,</hi> and others, inſtead of that of a <hi>Tyridates</hi> or <hi>Cleantes,</hi> will at firſt ſight commence an action againſt my Book. But I beg pardon of theſe nice and delicate Wits, if I make not, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their humour, thoſe whom I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for French Gallants, Grecians or Arabians. I am a plain man and give every thing its true name. I add my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition to thoſe whoſe names may have any conformitie with theſe which I have invented, that they would not think I had a deſign in it. They will eaſily ſee by the ſmall reſemblance that is to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their adventures and thoſe of my ſtories, that it hath been rather chance than intention. And let the worſt come to the worſt, I bring no Gallants on the ſtage but for their own advantage. Farewel, and pardon the faults that may have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Impreſſion.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hil'ſt the Court was at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> took the Air at the pleaſant Houſe of <hi>Vaux le Vicomte,</hi> where hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſuch extraordinary Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well deſerve to be put in Writing. It is well enough known how lovely a place
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100358:9"/>
               <hi>Vaux le Vicomte</hi> is; and that before the King became his own Treaſurer, none in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ever built ſo ſtately a Houſe of Pleaſure. One Evening when the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> was gone down into the Garden, to divert himſelf by reading ſome Verſes, he perceived there a beautiful young Lady, attended by a Woman of ſome years, on whom ſhe leaned as ſhe was walking. She had a Majeſtick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, an incomparable Neck, and the Face of an Angel; which ſurprized the Marqueſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never before beheld ſo charming an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Though he delighted much in Poetry, yet ſuch kind of Rencounters were always more proper to a waken and chear him, than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres and Sonnets. Having ſtopt a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that beautiful Lady, he afterward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards her; and as the old Woman that waited on her was ſaying, That it was great pity the Water-works did not play; he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that Divertiſement, and took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occaſion to ſpeak to her: But with what gallantry and civility ſoever he made his offer, he could not engage that raviſhing Beauty to enter into diſcourſe with him; he drew from her only two or three languiſhing looks, which pierced his very ſoul. This, ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, preſages an Adventure of conſequence; but come let us ſee what the iſſue will prove. He called the Overſeer of the Water-works, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100358:9"/>by the By ſtill let fall ſome word to the lovely melancholick Lady, who anſwered him only in ſighs. But as there is nothing that ſo much perplexes a man who ſpeaks well, as to be in company with thoſe who will not ſpeak a word; ſo the Gallant found himſelf in ſome trouble. However, all this was nothing: He brought the fair One to a little Bank of green Turf, where ſhe might at her eaſe behold the Water-works play. Hardly was ſhe ſate down, when turning her head, ſhe ſtarted up again in a great fright, crying to the Marqueſs of <hi>Riber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> Save me, Sir, from a man, who every where purſues me to carry me away; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid ſo, fled with incredible ſwiftneſs. The Marqueſs exceedingly amazed, perceived indeed a very handſom Gentleman running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, and endeavouring to overtake her. But the old Woman attempting to ſtop the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Lady, having fallen into the Canal where ſhe was like to be drowned, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to ſave her, before he purſued the others; and that gave time to the Lady and her Raviſher to run far enough, before he could come up with them. he called to the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of the Water-works and a foot-Boy, that if it was poſſible they ſhould ſtop the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but it was too late, for the adventurous Lover and unknown Lady were already got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court of the Caſtle; ſo that when the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100358:10"/>Marqueſs arrived, there was no body there, nor any thing to be ſeen, but on the other ſide of the draw-Bridge a Coach with ſix Horſes, which drove away in great haſte. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs raged, to ſee that which pleaſed him ſo well, raviſht away by force: And having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Horſes to be ſadled, he returned in the mean while into the Garden, that he might learn ſome information from the old Woman; but neither was ſhe to be found, for ſhe had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſlipt away. Alas! ſaid he, ſhe is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate in the Rape: With this his anger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled; and ordering his Servants to ſearch for her in the Neighbourhood, he himſelf takes horſe, and ſpeeds after the Coach. About half a mile from <hi>Vaux,</hi> he was told that the Coach took the way of <hi>Cambreux;</hi> and being informed that there was no body in it but a Gentleman and a Lady, he was fully confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Road of the Raviſher lay that way. He ſpurred on his horſe with all diligence the ſame way, and having advanced a League, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was of a ſudden overtaken by the night, he thought that he had found what he ſought after, fancying that upon a little height he eſpied the Coach of the Blade he had to do with; but he was miſtaken, for that Evening Deſtiny had appointed him for vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and many Adventures; it being another Coach which had ſtopt there. As he drew
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100358:10"/>near, inſtead of his raviſhed beauty, he found four Ladies, who diſtracted with fear, uſed their utmoſt attempts to hinder two men on Horſeback, from murdering a Gentleman in company with them.</p>
            <p>He had too bravely begun the Evening, not to play the Hero of a <hi>Romance.</hi> To me! Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, turn to me! cryed he, and fall not on a ſingle man, who hath nothing but a Sword to defend himſelf. With that ruſhing furiouſly upon the two Horſemen, he put them to flight, and delivered the Gentleman from danger, and the Ladies from fear. They were all of his Acquaintance, and the Gentleman the <hi>Chevalier de Montal,</hi> one of his beſt Friends. The four Ladies were <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux, Madam de Moulionne,</hi> a Judges Wife, <hi>Madamoiſelle de Velzers,</hi> a <hi>Hollands</hi> Lady, and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Kermas,</hi> a <hi>Bretton.</hi> They were going to ſee the Houſe of the late <hi>Monſieur le Prevoſt,</hi> a Counſellor of Parliament, which was to be ſold, and where they were to be treated by <hi>Madam de Moulionne.</hi> After they had rendered the Marqueſs a thouſand thanks for his aſſiſtance, they prayed him to tell them what good fortune had brought him thither ſo ſeaſonably. He freely told them his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and asked them news of the Coach that went to <hi>Cambreux:</hi> But they falling a laughing, told him, That he did but deviſe a Tale for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100358:11"/>pleaſure; which was another perplexity and confuſion for the poor Knight errant. Let me periſh, ſaid he, if what I ſay be not true. You jeer us Marqueſs, anſwered <hi>Montal;</hi> for it is very probable indeed, that a man ſhould make his appointment in ſuch a Garden as that of <hi>Vaux,</hi> in open day to carry away a Woman, and in the way too that you deſcribe; it is a thing that cannot ſo much as enter into the mind of a man of common ſenſe. But, good now! added <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> who knew the gallant humour of the Marqueſs; Know you not that <hi>Madamoiſelle de Sencelles</hi> lives not far from hence? And without obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Marqueſs <hi>de Riberville</hi> to tell us whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is going, is it not enough for us to gueſs it, that we may not ſhew our ſelves unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the good office he hath done us? Jeſt as much as you pleaſe, Lady, replied the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, but let me die if I follow not the Coach upon that very account I told you. If it be ſo, anſwered <hi>Madam de Moulionne,</hi> you had as good go back again; for it is the Coach of <hi>M. de Cambreux,</hi> who is going home with his Lady, and we gave them the good night as they paſſed us. The Marqueſs at that word turned again, and being as Guard to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they entertained themſelves pleaſantly, until the Coach came to the place where they were to lodge; where after many Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100358:11"/>and mutual promiſes of viſiting one another, the Marqueſs took his leave, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his way to <hi>Vaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Servants upon his return told him, That the old Woman had come back again into the Garden, with a Lackey in a dark green Livery, and that ſhe had prayed the Houſe-keeper, That if he chanced to hear any news of the young Lady, he would with all ſpeed acquaint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> her Aunt with it, who lived within a ſhort League of <hi>Vaux le Vicomte.</hi> They farther ſaid, That the old Woman entreated them to offer no injury to the Raviſher, if he happened to fall into their hands, becauſe that he had Orders from the Aunt to do what he did. But all this gave no ſufficient information to the poor Marqueſs; he pelted and vexed at the Houſe-keeper, becauſe he had not-ſtopt that old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and ſhortly after went to bed ſo penſive and troubled, that he could not ſleep all night. He was in deſpair, when caſting about he could find no clearing to ſo many doubts that held him in ſuſpence; and the beauty of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Lady running continually in his mind, he could not think on the glances that he had received from her, and that lovely melancholy wherewith ſhe ſmote his heart; but that he was out of all patience that he was not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Rape. Nevertheleſs about the break of day he fell into a ſlumber, with ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100358:12"/>that he might at length ſleep ſome hours; but he had not ſlumbered long, when fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he heard the fair Lady ſigh about his bed, he awaked with a ſtart, and haſtily open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curtains to ſee what the matter was, but ſaw nothing appear. He accuſed the power of his imagination for having ſo cheated him, and endeavoured to fall aſleep again; but the ſame ſighs renewed put him into an inconceivable perplexity. Having called his <hi>Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> he bid him ſearch about exactly, to ſee if any body lay hid in the Room; but the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was in vain, and ſerved only to increaſe his confuſion. A thouſand different thoughts diſtracted him, and his extravagance carried him ſo far, that he thought the Maid by ſome croſs accident might have died, and that her Ghoſt came to thank him, for the good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had of reſcuing her. In fine, Theſe ſighs being renewed again the third time, to the great amazement of the <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> who affirmed that the voice ſeemed to come from under the Bed, where notwithſtanding he had ſeen nothing; the Marqueſs was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could lye no longer abed. He called for his Gown, and having put aſide the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he might go into his Cloſet, he was ſurprized to ſee the door open, but called to mind afterward that he had forgot to ſhut it. Fair day-light began now to appear, and there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100358:12"/>he reſolved to diſperſe his diſmal thoughts, by reading ſome pleaſing Book; but for a third Adventure, he had not entered one ſtep, when he ſaw the beautiful young Lady aſleep on a Couch. She lay in a poſture ſo advantageous for her beauty, and for the light, that her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeemed to dart out rays of ſplendour. The riſing Sun that entered by an open win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, produced on her countenance and breaſt that was half naked, theſe wonderful effects. The Marqueſs was quite tranſported, as well by that ſurpriſing rencounter, as by the flame that Love at that ſight kindled in him of new. He ſtood in need of all his diſcretion to reſtrain the impetuoſity of his firſt tranſports; yet all he did was to approach that lovely ſleeper, and ſteal ſome kiſſes, whilſt ſhe ſlept ſo ſound, as not to be offended. He continued on his knees, beholding her for ſome time; and then that he might not anger her, by awakening her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was dreſt, he returned into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he put himſelf in condition to viſit her again with more decency. Hardly had he got on his cloaths, when of her ſelf ſhe awaked, which made him run in to teſtifie to her his joy, that ſhe had eſcaped the danger of being carried away; and having asked her what fortune had brought her into that place, a thouſand times he kiſſed her fair hands, whilſt ſhe gave her ſelf no trouble to reſiſt him. At
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100358:13"/>length with her accuſtomed melancholy ſhe made him anſwer, That being cloſely purſued, by good fortune ſhe found in a corner of the Houſe a door open; that ſhe threw her ſelf in at it unperceived by her Raviſher; and that having found that Cloſet under the Hangings half open, ſhe betook her ſelf to it as to a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, not thinking that her Enemy durſt have the boldneſs to purſue her thither; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many excuſes, for the liberty ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in doing ſo. To which the Marqueſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with love, falling on his knees, becauſe ſhe was ſtill ſitting on the ſide of the Couch, and tenderly ſqueezing her hands betwixt his own, made this reply in a moſt paſſionate manner: Madam, This is not the only liberty that you have taken in the Houſe of <hi>Vaux,</hi> and it is moſt willingly excuſed; and having told her the ſeveral Adventures that he had met with in attempting her reſcue, he adjured her moſt preſſingly to tell him her Enemy, to the end he might revenge her wrong. But the lovely Lady, caſting on him one of thoſe languiſhing looks which had already captivated his heart; <hi>Seigneur,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I have for Enemy the braveſt of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> but I wiſh him no hurt; all that I deſire is only to ſhun his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Marqueſs judging by the word <hi>Seigneur</hi> which ſhe uſed, that ſhe might be a Stranger; and being confirmed in his opinion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100358:13"/>becauſe ſome <hi>Italians</hi> were expected at Court, and that her Accent was not altogether <hi>French,</hi> he behaved himſelf towards her with greater reſpect than ever. He begg'd of her, that ſhe would at leaſt give him ſome notice of her condition, and promiſed to conduct her to what place of ſecurity ſhe ſhould deſire. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lady made anſwer in this manner:</p>
            <p>Know, generous Stranger, that I am Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the valiant <hi>Clelius,</hi> who was forced to fly to <hi>Carthage,</hi> thereby to avoid the fury of the laſt of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and who upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn contributed ſo much to the liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> My Name is <hi>Clelia,</hi> and my Actions are ſo famous, that none but they who live in the moſt diſtant Countreys can be ignorant of them. The Marqueſs, as if he had dropt from the Clouds at that extravagancy, immediately perceived the nature of her Diſtemper. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was man ſo much ſurprized, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on all the trouble he had taken for an hypocondriack perſon; nor could he pardon himſelf for the cares, fears and hopes, which had ſo ſeriouſly affected him on ſo ridiculous an occaſion. However, coming a little to himſelf again, and perceiving that the beauty of the Maid, which had pleaſed him ſo much, was nothing leſſened by her fancies, he took comfort, and reſolved to have the pleaſure of hearing her Story to an end. He put her again
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100358:14"/>on the Relation, and ſhe forgot nothing of all the ingenious Intrigues, that are to be found in the Romance of <hi>Clelia,</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Aronce,</hi> and that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady. She began with the embarking of <hi>Clelius</hi> for his <hi>African</hi> Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; recounted his Shipwrack, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he ſaved the young <hi>Aronce;</hi> how <hi>Aronce</hi> fell in love with her, and by what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>Horace</hi> became his Rival; the return of <hi>Clelius</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> after the expulſion of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins;</hi> how <hi>Horace</hi> was there choſen for Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to <hi>Clelia,</hi> and <hi>Aronce</hi> afterward diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Son of the King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> which made <hi>Clelius</hi> prefer him to <hi>Horace;</hi> and in fine, how that the day that ſhe was to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the illuſtrious <hi>Aronce,</hi> that fearful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake happened, which gave <hi>Horace</hi> occaſion to raviſh her from his Rival: Forgetting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as I have ſaid, of all that ſucceeded that Rape, until the Rencounter of the Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who attempted to have forced her from her Raviſher. And there ſhe thanked the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> whom ſhe took for that Prince, and at the ſame time made the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Vaux</hi> the Lake of <hi>Peruſa,</hi> on which the Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> fought againſt <hi>Horace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs perceived alſo by that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality which ſhe gave him, that by her eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpeaking of theſe Chimera's, ſhe inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed them; and though he took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100358:14"/>to hear her, yet he could not but pity ſo ſad a Diſtemper; he thought it fit to leave her to take a little reſt, that he might ſee whether in ſome good intervals, ſhe might not name other Parents than <hi>Clelius,</hi> whom he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with her being at <hi>Vaux.</hi> For that effect he recommended her to the Woman that kept his Houſe, who put her to Bed, and ordered ſome Maids to attend her. In the mean time the Marqueſs was told, that a Gentleman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with him, who proved to be the very ſame that the melancholick Lady had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Raviſher the day before. The impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience that the Marqueſs was in, to know the name and quality of that poor afflicted Maid, made him go meet that Gentleman immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might enquire if it was ſhe he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. The Gentleman anſwered him, That he had been every where about in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to hear news of her, but all in vain. The Marqueſs related to him the way how ſhe came into the Caſtle. I need not then, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gentleman, inform you of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you have eaſily diſcovered it, ſince you have made her ſpeak. All that I can tell you, Sir, is, That ſhe belongs to perſons of Quality, who are afflicted beyond meaſure to ſee her in that condition. It is certainly lamentable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Marqueſs, and I proteſt to you, that though I know her not but ſince yeſterday, yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100358:15"/>I have been ſenſibly affected, to ſee ſo rare a beauty in ſo great a diſorder; my ſurprize was extraordinary, when ſhe told me that her Name was <hi>Clelia.</hi> But, Sir, continued he, Is there no remedy for that Diſtemper? And is that poor Lady always in that prodigious diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mind? We believed her almoſt cured, anſwered the Gentleman, and ſhe was brought hither to walk, becauſe it is above ten days ſince ſhe ſhewed any ſign of Diſtemper. I have cauſed her be put to Bed, replied the Marqueſs, and there are Women here who are to take care of her, to ſee if her Fit do abate. Sir, ſaid the Gentleman, By what you tell me, it muſt be already over; for it never holds her above ten or twelve hours, and then for two days ſpace there appears not the leaſt alteration in her mind; ſhe is as rational as any other, ſings divinely, and is full of charms in converſation; but that now and then ſhe falls into I know not what kind of melancholy, which (as I believe) proceeds only from the reflexion ſhe makes on her misfortune; for ſhe is very ſenſible of it, and that is the thing that troubles her moſt, and the moſt ſingular ſymptom of her Diſtemper. Perhaps if no body ſhould ever ſpeak to her of <hi>Rome</hi> or the <hi>Romans,</hi> her Cure might be more eaſie; we obſerve, that on ſuch occaſions, her Fit takes her much ſooner than at other times; but there is no keeping of her ſhut up, for that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100358:15"/>increaſes her Melancholy, and irritates her Diſtemper; and it would be ſaid to inform all the Company with whom ſhe is, of the fancies that ſuch Subjects occaſion in her. I ask no more then, ſaid the Marqueſs, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſomewhat aſtoniſhed, what was the cauſe of the diſorder ſhe fell into laſt Evening. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that amongſt the Flouriſhes I ſpake to her, I compared the majeſty of her Body, and the beauty of her Face, to a certain <hi>Roman</hi> Lady whom ſhe reſembles, and whoſe Picture hangs in the Houſe; without doubt it is I that have ſpoilt all. O yes, ſaid the Gentleman, and my preſence hath compleated the diſaſter. You gave her ground, replied the Marqueſs, by running after her, to take you for <hi>Horace,</hi> and it is perhaps becauſe you are the Rival of ſome perſon whom ſhe loves. Alas! Sir, anſwered the Gentleman, that is but too true; hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was much in love with her, and am hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet free; but when you ſaw me yeſterday endeavour to overtake her, it was only for fear that ſhe might hurt her ſelf by running, for I imagined that her Fit had taken her. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I muſt thank you for the trouble you put your ſelf to on that occaſion; for I was told that you took Horſe with a very generous deſign. Yes certainly, anſwered the Marqueſs, laughing, you put me in a furious rage, and I took a ſtrange reſolution againſt you; if I had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100358:16"/>met you, we ſhould have undoubtedly had a trial whoſe the Lady ſhould have been. Then he told him of a ſecond Adventure he had had, in reſcuing the <hi>Chevalier de Montal,</hi> who was in danger of being aſſaſſinated. To which the Gentleman made anſwer, That he was the leſs troubled at <hi>Clelia</hi>'s Fit, ſeeing it was the cauſe that ſo gallant a man as <hi>Montal</hi> was not killed. But, Sir, continued the Marqueſs, I have a great mind ſtill to know, if you think fit, how that poor Lady fell into that Diſtemper; for how could ſhe be poſſeſſed with that folly, to believe <hi>Clelius</hi> to be her Father; that he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Carthage;</hi> that he ſaved <hi>Aronce;</hi> and that there happened an Earthquake, the day that ſhe ſhould have been married to that <hi>Aronce,</hi> if there were not ſome conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Adventures and thoſe of <hi>Clelia?</hi> To give you that ſatisfaction you deſire, anſwered the Gentleman, I muſt needs relate to you the whole Story, but then I ſhould ſuffer thoſe that expect news of her, to pine away with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Alas! Sir, replied the Marqueſs, That needs not trouble you, we ſhall ſend one of my Servants, who ſhall inform them to the full; and if you will take my advice, ſend for her Governeſs hither, it ſhall be her own fault if ſhe continue not here with her truſt, as long as ſhe pleaſes. I beſeech you then, ſaid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Cauſe that I may have Paper and Ink,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100358:16"/>to write a word to that Woman, otherways perhaps ſhe may make ſome difficulty to come. Yes, ſaid the Marqueſs, for I take her to be a little capricious; ſhe inſtead of ſtaying for my return yeſterday, fled out of the Garden, as if ſhe had been guilty of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. That was, that ſhe might not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſaid the Gentleman, to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſo ſtrange a Diſtemper, for the good Woman loves not to publiſh the blemiſhes of our Family. When the Note was written, it was ſent to the Governeſs, who lived with the Aunt of the young Lady, about a ſhort League off. They both afterward entered together into the Garden, and having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a convenient place to ſit in, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this manner began the Hiſtory of the fair diſtempered Lady.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Madamoiſelle <hi>Juliette d'Arvianne.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOU have ſometimes perhaps heard of the Counts <hi>d'Arvianne.</hi> They are one of the nobleſt Families in <hi>Gaſcoigne.</hi> The laſt Count of that Name, who died ſince the Marriage of the King, was Father to this lovely Lady. But that you may the better know the Reaſons, that have made her apply to her ſelf the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of <hi>Clelia,</hi> I muſt trace a little back the Hiſtory of the Father of my <hi>Heroine;</hi> I call her ſo, ſaid he, ſmiling, becauſe ſhe has made me act the part of a <hi>Romance</hi>-Squire with you. In the year 1644, the Count <hi>d'Arvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anne,</hi> with his Brother the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a great Ship, and another ſmall Veſſel, to go cruiſe with on the Seas. And as he ſet ſail from the mouth of the <hi>Garron,</hi> he came at the nick of time to be witneſs of the wrack of a forrain Ship, which was ſplit about the Tower of <hi>Carduan,</hi> and whereof he could only
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100358:17"/>ſave a little Child, which in its Cradle ſtuck to the Rock; all the reſt were by a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind blown off into the Sea, and periſhed, no body being able to conjecture to whom the Veſſel belonged. The Count took the poor infant-Boy, and recommended him to a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Wife; and having three months after returned from his cruiſing, and finding that no body owned it, he cauſed it to be carried to Madam the Counteſs <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> his Lady, who having had none as yet of her own in the ſpace of four years that ſhe had been married, took pleaſure to have it brought up. There is <hi>Clelius</hi> indeed, ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and ſhe has reaſon in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if ſhe have none in the application. Two years after, continued the Gentleman, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> was brought to Bed of a Daughter, who was called <hi>Julliette,</hi> and the Girl and Boy were brought up together until the War of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and there is nothing of Romance in what I am about to tell you; there could not be any thingmore accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed than theſe two Children. During this War, one of the Rebels thinking to gain my Father, by procuring him great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, propoſed to him <hi>Julliette</hi> in Marriage with me, who (though ſhe was not above five or ſix years old) was nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to me. There were great hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100358:18"/>of me; I had an Eſtate; I was a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the <hi>Chevalier d'Arvianne</hi> was dead, and it was thought there might be means found to reſtore the Houſe of <hi>Arvianne</hi> to its ancient ſplendor, by giving me that Maid with thirty thouſand Livers a year: For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam her Mother having an Infirmity, which hindered her from ever having more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I was to carry the Name and Arms of the Family. But the event of the War was quite contrary to what was expected; all theſe fair deſigns vaniſhed by the flight of the Count; he was forced to ſhelter himſelf in <hi>England,</hi> till he could juſtifie his innocence; his Eſtate was at the ſame time forfeited; <hi>Julliette</hi> was carried thither with the young Stranger, who had opportunity enough to gain her favours, as both grew in years. In a word, What ſhall I tell you? They fell both in good earneſt in love. The Count <hi>d'Arvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anne</hi> who perceived it, would not ſuffer that love to take root; what vertue ſoever he found ſhining in that <hi>Aronce,</hi> yet his Birth, perhaps, anſwered not to that of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and beſides he had no Eſtate. The Count reſolved then to ſeparate them; and the young Lad had no ſooner attained to the age of fifteen years, but that he ſent him from <hi>London,</hi> to one of the moſt famous Academies of the Kingdom, there to learn his Exerciſes.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100358:18"/>In the mean time the beauty of <hi>Julliette</hi> began to be talked of in the Court of the Protector. She was courted by many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords; and as amongſt a great many pretenders, there are always ſome that are more eager than the reſt; ſo the Son of a great Lord became ſo paſſionately in love with her, that his flame became known to all people. <hi>Julliette</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs correſponded not with it, but on the contrary wrote to her young Lover of the diſpleaſure ſhe conceived thereat, who falling into furious deſpair, that the Count <hi>d'Arvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anne</hi> approved of the pretenſions of his Rival, returned ſecretly to <hi>London,</hi> challenged the Lord's Son, dangerouſly wounded him, and was inſtantly apprehended. He that was wounded being a man of great Quality, the young Stranger was believed utterly ruined. The Count <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> himſelf was obliged in policy to forſake him; but here is again a Subject of application for our <hi>Clelia.</hi> One of the Lords of Parliament called the Marqueſs of *, having underſtood how that young man was reſcued from Shipwrack, and having conſidered the day and year when that Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack happened, obſerving beſides in the face of the Priſoner, ſome features that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he entered into ſome ſuſpicion that he might be his Brother's Son, whoſe Ship he always believed to have been caſt away the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100358:19"/>very ſame year when he fled from <hi>England,</hi> about the beginning of the Troubles. In fine, That Lord ordered ſo well ſome Seſſions of the Houſe, that he had time to inform himſelf. The Stranger was acknowledged for the Son of the Lord *, and his Uncle obtained his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I tell you not now of the joy of poor <hi>Julliette;</hi> ſhe was a real <hi>Clelia,</hi> that ſaw her <hi>Aronce</hi> owned to be the Son of King <hi>Porſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Such was her joy, that ſhe being unable to conceal it from all <hi>England,</hi> the wounded Rival died rather of deſpair than of his wounds. In the mean time the Marqueſs of * being highly in favour with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the Count <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> endeavoured to make his peace, by his mediation with Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi> and was again reſtored to his Eſtate. The young Lord returned alſo with his dear <hi>Julliette.</hi> She was about that time a Maid of fourteen years old, one of the moſt charming perſons in the World. They came afterward to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe read <hi>Clelia;</hi> and as ſhe read it, <hi>Monſieur de Scuderi,</hi> ſaid ſhe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, hath foretold in this Romance, the Adventures that I ſhould meet with. She could not forbear to admire that ſurprizing reſemblance between the Adventures of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> and her own; for two years together ſhe peruſed them day and night, during which time her Lord left her not without other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100358:19"/>There were no magnificent and great Treats which he beſtowed not on his lovely Miſtreſs; not that he ſpent all theſe two years in that amorous idleneſs, for he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Trained-Bands of <hi>England;</hi> but when he could ſteal any little time from the War, he came in Poſt to imploy it in his love. At length they came to treat of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns; and the Uncle of the young *, and the Count <hi>d'Arvianne,</hi> judging it an equal Match, reſolved to marry <hi>Julliette</hi> to her Lover, and returned into <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> to celebrate the Marriage. Here is again ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange reſemblance to the Romance of <hi>Clelia;</hi> The very day they were to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there happened at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> a furious Earthquake; flames and aſhes did not burſt forth as at <hi>Capua,</hi> but a kind of a Rock came out of the Earth upon the Bank of the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and ſome were ſwallowed up by it on the High-way, ſome Houſes were likewiſe overthrown. And, in a word, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of that Lady might in all reſpects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of the <hi>Roman Clelia,</hi> my jealouſie led me at the very hour of that diſorder, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Countrey-Houſe where the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was to be held, that I might endeavour to carry away <hi>Julliette;</hi> I came juſt in good time when the ſame Houſe began to ſhake and totter, to carry her away in my arms. And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100358:20"/>this, Sir, is the whole Hiſtory of <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle d'Arvianne,</hi> which gave a beginning to her Diſtemper. I purged my ſelf of the Rape whereof I was accuſed, under pretext of the Earthquake; but ſhe who knew the truth of the matter was thereby ſo offended, that a Fever ſupervening ſo diſcompoſed her mind, as by little and little ſhe came at length to imagine her ſelf to be <hi>Clelia.</hi> Sir, ſaid the Marqueſs, you have told me wonderful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but what became of the young *, after you carried away his Miſtreſs? The Count <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> and he, anſwered the Gentleman, eagerly purſued me; the one by way of Law accuſed me of having given her ſome amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Potion, and the other challenged me, with whom I fought twice. But, in fine, there being no hopes of <hi>Julliette</hi>'s Cure, his Uncle recalled him into <hi>England.</hi> Since that time the Count and Counteſs <hi>d'Arvianne</hi> are dead; and my Mother being next in kin to the diſtempered Lady, was charged with the Guardianſhip and tuition of her. That poor Maid hath been now almoſt ſix years afflicted with that Diſtemper without any Cure. She hath had all kind of Divertiſements; ſix months ago my Mother brought her to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhe hath been viſited by all the Phyſitians, who have not been able to find any remedy for her; neither the change of Air, nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100358:20"/>nor yet company and converſation, nor any thing elſe can alter that imagination; do but ſpeak to her of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or let her but ſee any object that may revive her fancies, ſhe falls immediately again into extravagancy; you had a ſufficient proof of it laſt Evening, when you diverted her with the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</p>
               <p>Having ſo ended his Story, he roſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to take leave of the Marqueſs, becauſe he had buſineſs that day at <hi>Fountain-bleau.</hi> The Marqueſs asked him if he would not ſee his Kinſwoman; but he judged it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, leſt that his preſence might do her more hurt than good; and therefore he took horſe, and purſued his way to Court.</p>
               <p>Hardly was he gone, when the Marqueſs being ſtill in the Court of the Caſtle, heard a Coach come to the Gate; and a little after ſeeing the <hi>Chevalier de Montal,</hi> and the Ladies who the Evening before promiſed to viſit him, come out, he ran in haſte to receive them. Immediately, <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux</hi> ſpeaking in name of all the reſt, told him, That they were come to know if the fair Lady that was carried away, had not broken his reſt. Look, Ladies, anſwered he, ſhewing them the Couſin of that Maid, who was but juſt got a horſeback, there is the Raviſher, my good Friend, who hath juſt left me. How,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100358:21"/>Sir, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting him, Have you really had news of her then? And the pleaſanteſt news in the World, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Marqueſs, that fair Lady is here between a pair of Sheets. You are happy, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> I would I had her as ſure. Ho! Be quiet, ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle Barbiſieux</hi> to him, you are already about to begin your uſual fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries. They entered all afterward into the Garden, with deſign to fetch a Walk before they went into the Houſe; and the Marqueſs being there preſſed to tell what he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his fair melancholick Lady, he recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Ladies the whole Story, as he had juſt before heard it. Well, really, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle de Barbiſteux,</hi> when he had made an end, I proteſt I ſuſpected laſt night that the Marqueſs had told us ſome made Tale, and did not in the leaſt believe that he was in chace of ſuch an Adventure. And ſo did I, added Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> I fancied that his ſurprize in having met us, when he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no ſuch thing, had made him invent on the ſpot that which he told us; for the truth is, there was ſo little probability in it, that if I had not heard what now I hear, I ſhould never have believed it, and I ſuſpected as you did, ſome other myſtery in his Journey. Ye do me too great honour, Ladies, ſaid the Marqueſs, and I am truly very much obliged
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100358:21"/>to you for theſe good opinions. We ſpeak not without reaſon, replied Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne;</hi> and I appeal to <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers,</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Kermas,</hi> if the other day we were not told ſuch things, as might very well give us ground to have that ſuſpicion of you. That's true, ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers;</hi> but if you will be ruled by me, let <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs alone, and let us endeavour to make the <hi>Chevalier</hi> as good as his word, in telling us a Story which he promiſed laſt night. Ah! You are in the right, anſwered <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> he told us, that the attempt that was made yeſternight upon his perſon, was the conſequence of a Love-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue; he muſt tell us what it was. With all my heart, anſwered the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> and the Story ſhall be no leſs pleaſant than that of the <hi>Gaſcoigne Clelia.</hi> At theſe words all held their peace; and thus he began.</p>

               <p>IF Monſieur the Marqueſs hath been in great trouble for an Hypochondriack Perſon, a fanciful Lady alſo was the cauſe that laſt Night I narrowly eſcaped being Murdered. There is a certain Lady who hath a Houſe on the Road to <hi>Marſals,</hi> that would be thought the greateſt Beauty of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and to have likewiſe the beſt Wit in the World. As to Beauty, without doubt, ſhe has her ſhare; and for a proof of that, Ladies, I have been in love with her, and am not ſo bad a Judge of Beauty as to love an ugly Woman; but as to her Wit, you will hardly agree with her in Opinion.</p>
               <p>At that time then when the King made his Expedition to <hi>Marſal,</hi> one of the lovelieſt Princes, not only of our Court, but of all <hi>Europe</hi> alſo; and I know, Ladies, that you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100358:22"/>are willing I ſhould conceal his name and quality: had I but nam'd him; a ſecret that I have long kept, would be ſure to come to his ears by to morrow, and therefore I think it not as yet convenient to ſee the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Hiſtorian! Said Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> he hath ſpoken but three words, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to ſhow his own vanity, and affront us! It is not to affront you, anſwered the Chevalier, to diſtruſt your tongues; for there was never Woman that could keep a Secret half a day. And think you, continued he, looking on her pleaſantly, that had it not been for that, I could have delayed till now to let you know I love you? Ha, ha! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> to the fair <hi>Hollander,</hi> there is a pretty way indeed of breaking Love, and I know not how you will take it from him; yet I think a Proteſtation made in that manner ſhould not be received with diſdain. The Lady, replyed <hi>Montal,</hi> bluſhes no leſs for anger; but the reaſon is, becauſe there is nothing truer than what I have ſaid. Good, good! ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> interrupting him, no body doubts but that you ſpake the truth in ſaying you loved her; and for all the bad opinion you have of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens tongues, it is far leſs doubted but that ſhe alſo is ſo ſecret in her love for you, as not to ſpeak of it to any; but make an end,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100358:23"/>if you pleaſe, of the Hiſtory of the Lady of <hi>Marſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prince, replied he, needing a little refreſhment on the Road, was forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the civilities of that houſe. And ſeeing ſhe was a Woman that let no occaſion ſlip of entertaining fancies and viſions, or that ſhe was of an humour to brag of every thing; ſhe would needs perſwade her Friends that the bare civilities that the Prince had ſhewed her, were a real declaration of Love. She had even the wit to make them believe that he made a halt only in her Village, that he might have a pretext to ſpeak with her. All her good Goſſips preſently adviſed her not to neglect ſo good a Fortune. They ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to follow that lovely Prince to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> and recommended to her care not to be ſparing in giving him encouragements. Go, ſaid they, Madam, you know not of what conſequence it may be to you, and one muſt not make Ceremonies with Princes as with other People. Theſe brave Counſels made the Lady go to <hi>Marſal,</hi> where I had the firſt time the honour to ſee and converſe with her; for perceiving her to be in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and that ſhe lookt for ſomething at Court; I offered my ſelf to wait on her whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever ſhe pleaſed; but ſhe told me that ſhe deſired no more but to ſee the lovely
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100358:23"/>Prince that I have been ſpeaking of at Dinner; which I procured her. My Friends placed her ſo commodiouſly and ſo full in view, that the Prince to the great ſatisfaction of her heart, eyed only her all the time of Dinner. Then it was that being her ſelf perſwaded, of what ſhe intended only to perſwade others; ſhe returned home full of pride and haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her conqueſt. The Lady who before that was proud of a crowd of Votaries, who flocked daily about her from ſix leagues in compaſs, thought it afterward a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be ſerved by Galants of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and there was not any, not ſo much as her Husband (whom even the bonds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony could not ſerve) that could avoid her ſlights; if he asked or ſtole any favour from her, it was a kind of Treaſon and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Publick, he took to himſelf what only belonged to the Prince, and ſhe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to undoe him. At that all the Company burſt out in laughing. There was, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> a fooliſh creature indeed, if it be not one of the fooliſh inventions of the Chevalier. Confound me, replied the Chevalier, if I add one word to the Story, and if I deſcribe not to you the humour of that Lady juſt as it really was. Nay, I have been told that ſhe ſo ſlighted her Husband, that the poor Countrey Gentleman was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100358:24"/>in a great fit of Love to beat her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would not ſuffer him to uſe her more kindly. In fine, ſhe led this life two years, until it pleaſed my deſtiny to make me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at Hunting with Monſieur <hi>de Laumer</hi> her Husband, who was come to <hi>Thoul</hi> where my Regiment lay. However I knew not that ſhe was the Wife of that Gentleman; for though ſhe had received from me at <hi>Marſal</hi> the good Office that I have told you; yet I informed not my ſelf of her name, and knew her not but by ſight. And that made me pleaſantly ſurpriſed to ſee her in <hi>Laumer</hi>'s houſe, when he treated me after we came from the Chaſe; but I may likewiſe ſay that the amazement I put her then in, was no leſs than mine own. <hi>Laumer,</hi> who perceived that his Lady changed colour when ſhe ſaw me, came familiarly and whiſpering me in the ear, Chevalier, ſaid he, be not ſurpriſed if my Wife look not favourably on you; ſhe is a Beaſt that uſes all people ſo, and is mad when I bring any man hither. Alas! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, ſhrugging up my Shoulders, let her look on me as ſhe thinks fit, and if ſhe pleaſe I ſhall not at all eye her. On the contrary, ſaid <hi>Laumer,</hi> you will do me a kindneſs to ſpeak to her: and turning to her, Wife, ſaid he, entertain this Gentleman, till I go and give orders for Dinner. Then it was that I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100358:24"/>fell in love with that Beauty. The curioſity that I had to make her change her humour which her Husband had ſet forth to me to be ſo cruel, and the convenience that he gave me of being with her alone, were the firſt cauſes of my love. Your Husband, ſaid I to her, Madam, ſo ſoon as he was gone out, has been telling me a ſtrange thing of you. Is it poſſible, Madam, that you give ſo bad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to thoſe whom he brings hither to adore you? for to ſee and adore you is but one and the ſame thing. She fetched a little ſigh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe anſwered to that, and then turning her eyes amorouſly towards me, Sir, ſaid ſhe, If I had as great obligation to all thoſe whom my Husband brings hither, as I acknowledge my ſelf to have to you; I ſhould not ſo much diſlike their Company. As ſhe ended theſe words, her Husband returned, and hindered me to anſwer their kindneſs; the kindneſs was not ſo great as you take it to be, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> and it might very well have admitted an explication. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that, replied he, but for my part, who never deſire more of a Woman, to make me believe my ſelf in good terms with her, and who beſides, had no ground to believe it was a riddle, I had not failed to have thanked her by a fair declaration of Love, if her Husband had not by his coming prevented me. That
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100358:25"/>had been very pleaſant, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> ſhe would have certainly ſcratcht out his eyes. Juſt ſo as ſhe ſcracht them out, anſwered he, when I made that declaration three days after. I ſent it to her cautiouſly by one of my Lacqueys, and received a very favourable anſwer. As you ſay, ſays Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> again interrupting him. —'Slife! there it is ſtill, ſaid the Chevalier, plucking it out of his Pocket, and you may read it if you will. Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> took it, and whilſt <hi>Barbiſieux</hi> looked over her Shoulders, ſhe read in it theſe words:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                     <head>To Monſieur, The Chevalier <hi>de Montal.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>YEs, Sir, I ſhall always reckon my ſelf the happieſt Woman in the World, in having obtained your acquaintance, and without doubt your firſt cares have ſenſibly affected me. I would, if it were poſſible abide with you always, not to ſpeak of any thing elſe; but however I pray you entertain no love for me; for that will do us both an injury.</hi>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>Conceive who can the meaning of that anſwer, ſaid the Marqueſs, it is an admirable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100358:25"/>quibble; for when the Lady ſays that ſhe is happy in having obtained acquaintance of the Chevaller, and that his firſt cares have pleaſed her, it is clear ſhe means of the pains he took to get her in to ſee the Prince Dine; But ſurely, added Madam <hi>de Mulionne,</hi> for one to have anſwered in theſe terms, the note of the Chevaller muſt have been alſo no leſs ambiguous on his part. How I? ſaid the Chevalier, I wrote to her that I was very much obliged to her for the good reception ſhe had given me; and that if I thought that my firſt cares had not diſpleaſed her, I ſhould uſe all my Art to ſee her as often as I could. To conclude, I prayed her to be aſſured that ſhe had rendered me the moſt amorous of all men. However it be, Ladies, continued he, what ignorance ſoever I might have of the meaning of that note, yet it made me down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Love. And from that time I began to contrive a thouſand devices to ſee her; and I had the more reaſon to do ſo, in regard her Husband grew Jealous of me, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me no more to come to his houſe. That deſign coſt me a good deal of Money at <hi>Thoul,</hi> for the ſpace of a whole Winter that ſhe lived there with her Jealous Husband, who had a fuit at Law there. He would not ſo much as leave her alone in his houſe. I uſed all colours and pretexts that I might ſpeak
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100358:26"/>with him, until at length having found an occaſion to tell him that ſhe ſeemed to be angry becauſe I had ſollicited on their behalf; that Artifice leſſened a little the diffidence of her Husband. Then did I diſguiſe my ſelf into Womans Apparel, that I might go often to her Lodgings; which ſucceeded ſo well with me, that every time her Husband was abroad, I never budged from thence. But to my ſhame I muſt confeſs that I gained no ground upon the Lady, and that after a great many ambiguous diſcourſes, and at leaſt as many ſighs as I have already ſpent for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>Velzers;</hi> I thought I had fallen from the Clouds, when out of pity ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make me her confident, being ſhe could not admit of me for a Gallant. That happened in the moſt pleaſant way imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for as in the height of tranſport I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her knees, accuſing her of cruelty for being the cauſe of my Death, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that I wiſhed to have been the Son or Brother of the King, that I might have better deſerved her favours; ſhe fetched a deep ſigh, and giving me her hand to kiſs, as a ſignal teſtimony of kindneſs: Ah! ſaid ſhe, dear Chevalier, how cruel are you to prick me in the Sore! And why ſo, Madam? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, taking what ſhe ſaid as meant for my ſelf; would your ather that I ſhould dye
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100358:26"/>by keeping ſilence? Go, go, continued ſhe, I will no longer abuſe your patience; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I know the power of the affection you have for me, I will likewiſe by the confeſſion I am about to make to you, teſtifie what a great eſteem I have for your merit. After that, I expected no leſs than that ſhe would give me aſſurances of my happineſs, and in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation even exſpiring in Love; to ſay the truth, I know not what I was not preparing to do, when the fanciful Woman ſtabbed me by the fooliſh confeſſion of her Love for the Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though I perceived my hopes fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, yet I could not forbear to laugh; and the novelty of that extravagancy ſo ſtrangely amazed my Love, that it ſeemed to fly as faſt out, as it had entered into my heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the vexation that I was in for having ſpent ſo much Money in vain, and a certain point of honour, which ye may name as ye pleaſe, would not ſuffer me wholly to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my purſuit; and changing my battery with her, I told her I was obſtinately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be her Fop. I perſiſted daily in a diſguiſed habit to render her Viſits, and carried on my deſigns ſo well with her in the quality which ſhe offered me of a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that I deſired no other. I gave her conſtantly advantageous deſcriptions of the Prince, which was a thing that might be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100358:27"/>done without fiction; I pretended that he was in Love with her, that I might render her more amorous; and adding a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſo to order matters, that ſhe ſhould one day enjoy him in private, and that the Prince himſelf ſhould be deſirous upon my return to Court, to come and ſee her <hi>incognito;</hi> I put her into ſo great a tranſport and exceſs of Joy, that I may tell you freely, ſhe gave her ſelf in prey to my Love without conſidering what ſhe did. Ah! Madam, ſaid I to her one time, ſitting by her upon the Bed where ſhe ſtill lay, and impudently ſtroaking her fair Breaſts; if it were the Prince, when it is but a bare Confident that taketh this liberty, what pleaſure would it be. O! extravagant Woman, cried Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Good Madam, added <hi>Barbiſieux,</hi> ſay rather extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Man, for telling us ſuch improbable fopperies. Ah! replied he, let me become the moſt miſerable wretch that ever was, if I tell you not the truth, and if it be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Lady would not have repulſed me, provided I had undertaken nothing, but by way of compariſon to what the Prince might have done. Well, well, Chevalier, ſaid the ſame Lady, looking with a kind of ſevere gravity, we tell you in plain terms that we deſire not to hear ſuch follies. But Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle, anſwered he, you deſire to know
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100358:27"/>my Story, and theſe are the chief points of it; ye muſt reſolve to have a little patience if ye be curious to hear the reſt. Come, come, go on, ſaid the Marqueſs, I le ſtop them if they intend to be gone. Goodneſs, replied the Chevalier; as if it behoved them not, to be nice and ceremonious in every thing; their honour is concerned that way, but it's no matter, I ſhall have a care what I ſay. In fine Ladies, amidſt my delights, Heaven thought fit to give me a trial of its vigour; I received Orders from Court to march with my Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another Town at a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I leave you to gheſs how much I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed my fortune to the Lady; how much I accuſed the Court of Injuſtice, that ought not to have been ignorant that I took more pleaſure at <hi>Thoul</hi> than any where elſe. And for your ſakes, and to ſpare your ſcrupulous Modeſty; I will not tell you neither that ſhe gave me above a thouſand kiſſes at parting. She fondly regretted the abſence of a man who acted ſo well the part of his Prince. She ſent me above twenty moſt tender and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Letters, to put me in mind of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her to the Prince; and ſhe importuned me ſo much, that at length the Idea of her Beauty, that could do any thing upon a man of my temper, made me take the reſolution that I am about to tell you. Upon a day
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100358:28"/>when the Feaſt of St. <hi>Hubert</hi> was to be kept, I returned purpoſely into the Neighbourhood of her houſe; and taking with me four or five of my Troopers, I went a Hunting with the reſt; where, in cold blood I killed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of her Husband's Dogs, and made ſome other ravage on his Ground. The Lady whom I had informed, ſolicited him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to purſue his revenge, and perſwaded him to ſue me criminally. The Suit as we had well foreſeen, was removed before the King's Counſel, by reaſon of ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the fair Lady continuing her rage againſt me, ſhe offered to go her ſelf and ſolicite it: The Husband at firſt made difficulty enough to carry her thither; but a troubleſome Gout to which he was ſubject though ſtill young, nailed him to his Bed; and the affair being preſſing, he at length ſent her all alone to <hi>Paris.</hi> I inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, and there were renewed our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, until an occaſion of doing better preſented. That precious occaſion and more favourable than I expected, happened at laſt, by means of the King's leaving <hi>Paris,</hi> and going to St. <hi>Germans,</hi> after the Death of the Queen Mother; for the Councel having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King, Madam <hi>de Laumer</hi> had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to go thither alſo, and there it was that I deſired to have her. I imparted there the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100358:28"/>ſecret of my good fortune to one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Officers. And ſeeing there is not any Courtier who is not willing to ſerve his Friend in the affair of his Miſs; I made him promiſe to go ſee the Lady, as if it had been by order, and in name of his Maſter; to the end that if ſhe promiſed any pleaſant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, I might go under the name of the Prince, and ſweetly ſpend them with her. O what Knavery! ſaid the young Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> I have heard of that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, added the Marqueſs, but believed not, ſaid he to the Chevalier, that you were the Heroe, and there was no body named in it. That is true, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> becauſe I was made to promiſe ſolemnly never to publiſh it; but the countenance of the affair is now changed. Matters being then ordered in this manner, I brought the Lady to the old Palace, there ſhe ſaw the Prince Dine once more; for he was come to wait on the King that day. My Friend failed not after Dinner to deliver her the Meſſage we had agreed upon; told her that the Prince knew her to be the ſame Lady with whoſe Beauty he had been ſmitten on his way to <hi>Marſel,</hi> and at <hi>Marſel</hi> it ſelf, and that he had ſent him to wait upon her, to entreat her that ſhe would ſuffer him to come ſee her the Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. She look't big at firſt, and ſeemed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100358:29"/>to arm her ſelf againſt ſuch a Propoſition, after the manner of the Sex, who reject at firſt the pleaſures they moſt deſire. The Prince, anſwered ſhe, weeping, hath but a very ſmall eſteem for me, in deſiring to begin where he ſhould end; muſt a poor Woman then be ſo unhappy, that ſhe cannot love a Man, but ſtraight he muſt imagine it to be for ſuch fooleries? and from the meaneſt Gentleman even to the Prince, ſo ſoon as ever they think that one loves them, is that the fair Complement they have to make us? Her tears interrupted a little that Lamentation. Then as if ſhe had gained a conſiderable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over her love; no Sir, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to that. Well then, replied my Friend, withdrawing coldly, I'le go give the Prince your anſwer. Bleſs me, replied ſhe, what haſte you are in; would you have me ſay yes, at firſt daſh? ought you not to find out ſome reaſons to overthrow mine, before you go? if all Meſſengers were of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, no Lady ſhould be reduced to give ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting denials.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> could not forbear to interrupt him again, ſaying, Here's a man for you indeed, of whom we ſhould have a ſpecial care, if we will believe him, and who gives pretty Characters of Women. Madam, anſwered he, I give you the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100358:29"/>a of fooliſh fond Woman, who reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles none of you; but I have not ſaid one half of what I might have told you of her. You know Saint <hi>Soulieu,</hi> continued he, addreſſing himſelf to the Marqueſs, and ſeeing he is the man that I employed, you may judge what he is able to do. It is true, ſaid the Marqueſs, Saint <hi>Soulieu</hi> is a great Buffoon. Let me die! added the Chevalier, if he had not an hours diſcourſe with that fantaſtical Lady, where they ſaid things infinitely more pleaſing than what I have related to you, if I could but call them to mind. Well, well, much alike, I believe, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> make an end. Ah! Lady, replied he, how do I love that charming unpatience in you! it is a ſign that you are curious to hear of lovely paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. With theſe words he put her to a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bluſh; and then continuing his diſcourſe; at length ſaid he, the Lady granted the Prince the interview that he deſired, but with condition ſtill, that to eaſe her Modeſty, ſhe ſhould expect him without a light, which after that they had made their acquaintance might be allowed: and in that ſhe did but luckily prevent the demand that Saint <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> was to make to her about that caution. It was then agreed upon that the Prince ſhould come about midnight with a Dark Lanthorn only, which he ſhould not open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100358:30"/>the Lady gave him leave: That her Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord where ſhe lodged ſhould leave the Door open all Night: That he ſhould watch alone, and that he ſhould ſuffer thoſe that minded to ſee her at that time of Night to go up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber, without informing himſelf who they were; which Saint <hi>Soulieu</hi> in name of the Prince, immediately ordered the Landlord to do, who took it as a great honour that ſo Noble an Intrigue ſhould be carried on in his houſe. I went on in my part to act the Prince the beſt way I could, and when the hour was come, which I expected with the impatience of a man of good aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I ſet out with my Friend Saint <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> to go to the field of Battel; but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful misfortune which I had no ways foreſeen, waited for me there; the Husband being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that I ſolicited his Lady more than my Judges, and being free from his Gout, was come purpoſely to <hi>Paris,</hi> to obſerve our Conduct. Having not found his Beauty at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſtayed no longer than to bait his Horſes, and came with all ſpeed to St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Being conducted by the Hoſtler ſtrait to his Ladies Lodgings, he asked the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord where her Chamber was, who taking him for one of the Princes Officers, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhewed it him; he went up juſt a little before I arrived, and his Wife having at his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100358:30"/>entry called him his Highneſs, taking him for the Prince, was the cauſe of a terrible diſorder; for as I entered her Chamber im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after him, he caught hold of me by the Arm; I was forced to open my dark Lanthorn to know who it was, and the Lady at the ſight of her Husband fainted away: the Jealous man followed me out into the Street, whither, notwithſtanding his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I ran. We both drew, and had come to blows, if Saint <hi>Soulieu,</hi> and a great many of the Neighbours had not parted us. And this, Ladies, added the Chevalier, is the true cauſe of the accident that befell me yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Saint <hi>Soulieu</hi> however made a kind of accommodation betwixt us; for ſeeing we made uſe of the Princes name, we were glad to prevent the noiſe of that adventure from coming to his ears, though the Prince himſelf would have but laughed at it. And after it had been repreſented to the jealous Husband, that this happy arrival had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his ſhame on that occaſion; after a thouſand Oaths, I was forced to take that I ſhould never mention it, and he, that he ſhould never remember it more; in fine, after that I had willingly condemned my ſelf to pay the expenſes of the Law Suit; they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us to embrace one another, and I did it as heartily, as if I had entertained no grudge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100358:31"/>for having hindered me from embracing his Lady; notwithſtanding you ſaw by the baſe action he intended to have committed laſt Night, that he hath leſs patience than I? And that is the reaſon that for the future I ſhall not forbear to tell ſome good Tales to his coſt.</p>
               <p>And by what chance, ſaid the Marqueſs to the Chevalier, came he to meet you ſo pat on the Road? By what chance, replied the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, I proteſt I know not; unleſs that Traytor ſpied me at <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> where I ſaw him four or five days ago. In truth, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> there was never a more pleaſant Story; nor more fooliſhly told, added the Marqueſs. True, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> the Chevalier is none of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeteſt men amongſt Ladies. Ye complain when ye are too well ſerved, anſwered he. If ye imagine to make him change his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Velzers,</hi> ye are much miſtaken. Ye are all true Hypocrites, replied the Chevalier, and pretend to be vexed at that which pleaſes you moſt; and if there were any thing to be found fault with in my way of Relation, it is to Madamoiſelle <hi>de Kermas</hi> who hath not ſaid a word, that I ſhould refer my ſelf, rather than to you; but I know very well that ſhe has found no hurt in my diſcourſe. How, I? ſaid that Lady,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100358:31"/>I never play the Philoſopher on the words of an Hiſtorian, and I barely mind the Story, without conſidering the Ornaments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is ſet off. It had been better, replied her Companion <hi>Velzers,</hi> that you had been ſtill ſilent, than to have opened your lips to make ſuch an anſwer; and to declare againſt us. But what would you have me ſay? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that Lady; there is no hurt to be found in ſuch Stories, but what people imagine to themſelves. What ſtill? ſaid Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne;</hi> ah! verily I believed till now, that you were ſilent for anger, when the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier told his fopperies; but ſince you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch thoughts, I will not ſay all I think of you. Say, ſay it boldly, continued the Chevalier; for I for my part maintain, that Madamoiſelle <hi>Kermas</hi> is the diſcreeteſt Lady of all you four.</p>
               <p>During this diſcourſe, the Marqueſs had ſtept aſide, and was reading a Letter with a great deal of Secreſie. Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzer</hi> drew near, to ſee if ſhe could diſcover what it was; and at a pretty diſtance perceived it was a Letter which ſhe had dropt out of her Pocket. And as ſhe endeavoured to recover it. It is a Love-Letter, ſaid the Marqueſs, it comes from a happy man, and the violence that ſhe uſes to ſnatch it from me, ſhews very well that ſhe is concerned in it. How?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100358:32"/>Lady, ſaid <hi>Montal</hi> to her, I have a happy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal then? O! no, ſaid ſhe almoſt out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; that is a Story wherein I have no ſhare. If it be a Story replied he, you ſhall tell it then, as well as we have told ours; otherwiſe we ſhall think of it as we pleaſe. In reality, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> it would make a ſubject of the braveſt Romance in the world, if every one would tell their Story. I offer mine, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux.</hi> And I ſhall tell one likewiſe, added Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> And I four if ye pleaſe, ſaid the Marqueſs. With theſe words, he took the Letter which was directed to Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>Velzers;</hi> having firſt asked her ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times if ſhe conſented he ſhould read it aloud, becauſe it was conceived in very ſcandalous terms; but ſhe her ſelf urged him to give that diverſion to the Company; I am in no great trouble, ſaid ſhe, I know how to repair mine honour when I have a mind. And here is the lovely Letter.</p>

Are the longeſt and faireſt days to be compared to one ſole moment of the night, which I have ſpent in adoring you? And is there any felicity to be found but in the bonds of thoſe Lillies and Roſes which have hugg'd me ſo tenderly? I could not conceive why a Woman called that, the granting of the laſt and higheſt favour which was often but the firſt; but ſweet experience hath at length unfolded to me that amorous Riddle. When a beauty reſolves to bſtow ſuch as I have had, it is certainly a laſt favour which ſhe grants to him that receives it, ſeeing he muſt needs die of pleaſure.</hi>

               <p>The Marqueſs gave back the Letter to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle Velzers;</hi> who laughed heartily to ſee the amazement that the reading of it had put her Friends and the <hi>Chevalier de Montal</hi> in. You would make us believe by that laughter, ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> that there is ſome hidden myſtery in it, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects your honour; but in truth it is a fearful thing to be heard, and it is to be void of ſhame and modeſty to have ſuffered that Letter to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100358:33"/>read. I ſhall be thought naught, anſwered ſhe, continuing ſtill to laugh, until that I have told the Story that hath given occaſion to it; and I ſhall therefore do it without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; for I find you are ſuch as have no favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of me. You will do well to do ſo, ſaid <hi>Montal;</hi> and I ſhall hang my ſelf if I ſee not the explication of that horrible Letter.</p>
               <p>However, Before ſhe made the Relation, the Marqueſs prayed the Company to enter the Houſe, in regard the Sun began to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode them in the Garden; and having taken <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> in one hand, and Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> in the other, and the <hi>Chevalier</hi> having done the like to <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Velzers</hi> and her Companion, they went all together to learn News of the fair <hi>Clelia,</hi> whom her Governeſs was come to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>

            <p>THE indiſpoſed Beauty was now come to her ſelf again, and fully ſetled; and perceiving that brisk Company came in, ſhe received them with ſo much civility, and ſo compoſed a mind, that no body could judge her ſubject to the extravagancy that ſhe commonly fell into. The Ladies were no leſs ſurprized with her Beauty, than the Marqueſs had been, and confeſſed they had never ſeen ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Face, ſuch charms in a Mouth, nor ſo much grace in the actions and behaviour of any Lady. The Marqueſs conſidered her more than all the reſt, and felt the ſame flame that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100358:34"/>the firſt ſight of her hand kindled in his heart, again revived; though the knowledge of her Diſtemper had almoſt ſtifled it. In the mean while the diſtempered Lady durſt not ſo much as look upon him, becauſe ſhe knew that he had been a witneſs of her laſt Fit, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred very well every thing that had paſſed between them. In fine, They all left the Chamber, that they might go ſee the ſtately Appartments of the Houſe, except Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> whom the Marqueſs prayed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with that lovely Maid, that ſhe might perſwade her Governeſs to permit her to come and dine with the Company. But that Lady had no ſooner offered to ſpeak, but that the unfortunate <hi>Clelia</hi> thus interrupted her; Alas! Madam, (ſpeaking in a moſt pleaſant air) Whither would you carry a poor wretch, whom her affliction renders the ſport of all the World? There are none here, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> who are not grieved to behold ſo raviſhing a Beauty as you are, in ſo great misfortune. But come along, continued ſhe, embracing and kiſſing her, It ſhall be our care to divert you whilſt you are well, and perhaps that may not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the recovery of your health. Ah! Would to God that might be true, anſwered the lovely Maid, ſighing; but I have no ſuch hopes. At theſe words, her Governeſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100358:34"/>many reaſons to perſwade her to accept of the honour that was offered her, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come, and Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> went to acquaint the Company with it.</p>
            <p>At her return ſhe found the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> to his great regret, had begun a Ball in the Hall; and indeed he had ſome reaſon, for there were no more men there but himſelf. He was all in a ſweat, having the Dance to lead to three Ladies, and beſides the Muſick of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, which played raviſhingly to encourage him; whereof the malicious Ladies taking advantage, gave him not the leaſt reſpite. He made a pretext of the News that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> had brought, to break off that tireſome Exerciſe; and that amiable Woman could never have arrived more ſeaſonably for him, and therefore he thanked her as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. And as if he only had expected her, that he might take his revenge, he took her by the hand, led her to the place where the Marqueſs was, and as he was going, drolled moſt pleaſantly upon his three skipping Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
            <p>After this the indiſpoſed Lady came with her Governeſs, whom the three other Ladies having ſaluted, and entertained with much civility, they brought her to the place where the reſt were. The Marqueſs in a ſhort time had cauſed to be prepared a moſt ſumptuous
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100358:35"/>Feaſt; the Cloth was laid in one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that looks into the Garden, where a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he had regal'd a lovely Princeſs; and the ſame Machines which he had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that occaſion, having likewiſe ſerved for this Dinner, the Company were ſurprized at the Gallantry. The Table in appearance had nothing extraordinary; but over head hung a great <hi>Cupid,</hi> holding a Bottle in each hand, and ſo ingenuouſly made, that one would have taken it for a real Boy; there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared nothing to hold it, but the end of its Scarf, which the wind ſeemed to ſhake and carry up to the Cieling, and amongſt the foldings of that Scarf there was a little Pipe hid, with ſo much art, that when any of the Company intended to drink, they had no more to do but to preſent the Glaſs to the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> and at the very inſtant the Engineer that lay hid, or ſome body elſe making the Engine play, that little God poured out of one of his Bottles Wine, and out of the other Water, ſo that there needed no body but Servants to give and waſh the Glaſſes. The Dinner was ſerved up in the richeſt Diſhes that ever any one of the quality of a Marqueſs had. All the time of Dinner a Set of Violins played in an adjoyning Gallery, where by reaſon of the Ecchoes they ſeemed no leſs than an hundred. And on the other hand, whenſoever the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100358:35"/>made a pauſe, a thouſand Birds in a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made a delightful conſort, and very well ſupplied the place of the Inſtruments; they thought themſelves to be in an inchanted Caſtle. But that was not the thing that gave the greateſt ſatisfaction to that lovely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for when they had riſen from Table, and that the Servants had removed the Diſhes, for an augmentation of ſurprize, they ſaw the <hi>Cupid</hi> which hung over head, change its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and deſcending lower, take hold of the Cloth in one of its hands, and immediately vaniſh by an opening made in the Cieling, from which at the ſame time iſſued out a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſmoke of Perfumes, which ſhaped it ſelf into a kind of Cloud. And as their eyes were taken up in conſidering that wonder, the Table likewiſe vaniſhed, ſinking down ſo ſuddenly into the Floor below, which was inlaid with the ſame Figures that the Table was, that having but juſt filled the opening that was made in the Floor, they believed that it had diſappeared by Enchantment; however there was more invention than coſt in that Gallantry. After this the beautiful <hi>Clelia</hi> took a Theorb, which lay on a Table with ſeveral other Inſtruments, and by her dexterity in playing charmed all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; to which joyning her voice, ſhe no leſs raviſhed all that heard her.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:100358:36"/>
            <p>Theſe Perfections ſerved only to increaſe the pity that the Ladies had conceived of her Diſtemper; but they ſo forceably re-enflamed the love of the Marqueſs, that it was now no more in his power to forbear it. And whilſt the <hi>Chevalier</hi> imployed himſelf in entertaining <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> and that the lovely <hi>Hollander,</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Kermas</hi> were gone to take a turn in the Gallery, he fell on his knees before that witty indiſpoſed Lady, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her for ſome time with much pleaſure, expreſſed himſelf to her with ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection, that ſhe began to be weary of his Courtſhip; and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux</hi> liſtened with leſs attention to the foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Montal,</hi> that ſhe might lend an ear to their diſcourſe. I am willing that all the World know that I adore <hi>Madamoiſelle d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianne,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs, turning towards the curious Lady; and though I ſpeak low to her, it is not that I deſign to make a Secret of it. Alas! Sir, replied the agreeable <hi>Clelia,</hi> If you entertain for me the thoughts you ſay, conceal rather than publiſh them, elſe you will be cenſured for having made a bad choice of the object of your adorations. No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> that would be a very unjuſt conſideration to make him conceal them; but rather he ſhould do ſo, for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100358:36"/>fear you may be counſelled to reject them, as a thing that is common to too many. I know as much of the Marqueſs as any body can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the fair <hi>Clelia,</hi> ſmiling; and ſo ſoon as I underſtood that his Name was <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> I well thought to meet with ſome Flouriſhes from his hands. How? ſaid the Marqueſs, in great amazement, but ſtill with a tranſport of joy; Do you know me then? Yes, yes, Sir, anſwered ſhe, and I know her likewiſe with whom you had your laſt Adventure. Good now! lovely Lady, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> tell us that Story, I pray you. Ah! If you tell it, immediately added the Marqueſs, name no body; for there is nothing truer, than that that Lady who has been brought on the ſtage, was not in the Room with me, and that they are her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who have ſpread abroad that report. Ho! ho! ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> He is afraid the Parties ſhould be named, and he ſpeaks of a Lady in a Room; this muſt be a Story of importance. Dear <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> continued ſhe pleaſantly, For all love diſpatch and tell it us, that I may write an account of it to <hi>Hermin Villiers;</hi> for there lives a poor unfortunate Lady, who has the folly to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he never loved any but her. The indiſpoſed Lady, whom the Subject of ſuch an Entertainment began to make a little chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100358:37"/>took pleaſure to ſee the Marqueſs a little diſturbed at that Raillery, whatever counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he put upon the matter. However, with much ſweetneſs, ſhe told him; Be not alarmed, <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs, I ſhall name no body, ſeeing you will have it ſo: And then turning to <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> ſhe thus began.</p>

               </head>
               <p>YOU muſt know, Ladies, That <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs having been laſt Winter at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> made a great many Miſtreſſes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100358:37"/>there; but applied himſelf more particularly to two very handſome Ladies, who were Neighbours and good Friends; I am miſtaken, if it was not reported that they were Siſters, or at leaſt firſt-Couſins. And becauſe he could not ſee the one with ſo much liberty as he could have wiſhed, he forſook her, that he might give himſelf wholly to the other, whom he waited on with more freedom. The <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſians,</hi> who are an ill-ſpeaking People, give it out that he had his ſatisfaction of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Ah! ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting her, that is truly a great calumny. I believe it, replied the charming <hi>Clelia;</hi> and if ſhe had not been jealous of her Couſin or Siſter, as you pleaſe to name her, that had never been reported of her: But to be ſhort, it hath been ſaid, and it is a great croſs to her.</p>
               <p>The Amours of the ſecond, continued then that amiable young Lady, made ſo great noiſe, by the care that the Couſin had to divulge them, that the Husband grew jealous, and diſcharged his Wife ever to receive the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs any more into her Houſe; and that was the reaſon that they kept their Aſſignations afterward in a Houſe without the City. The Lady ſlipt ſlily out of doors, by the intelligence of her Porter and Chamber-maid, ſo ſoon as her Husband was gone to the Palace, whither he ſometimes went at Four a Clock in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100358:38"/>Morning. Yet they had not taken their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſo well one day, but that the concerned Couſin, who ſuſpected their commerce, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Secret. She had notice from her Spies, that they had ſeen her Rival diſguiſed in Mourning, come out of her Houſe, and by the Rampart march privately to the Town-gate; that the Marqueſs, on his part, had left his Chair-men at the ſame Gate, where he ordered them to expect his return, and that from thence he had haſtened away on foot to the place of Aſſignation. She loſt no time; and thinking that ſhe had found the faireſt occaſion in the World to revenge her ſelf on her unfaithful Lover, ſhe went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and awakened the Governour's Lady of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> who, as you know, Ladies, is Siſter to the Marqueſs. She told her that he was gone to Fight; and to colour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that ſhe had in it, added, That he had choſen a Couſin of hers for his Second; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Siſter loved a Brother better than the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Lady of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> loves hers. All in a fright ſhe called immediately for her night-Gown, and in that diſorder running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Husband's Chamber; Alas! Sir, ſaid ſhe, I am juſt now told that my Brother is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a Quarrel, and that he is gone abroad betimes this Morning, with the Couſin of ſuch a Lady who is his Second; hinder them, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100358:38"/>it be poſſible, from Fighting. The Governour inſtantly gave Orders that Guards ſhould be ſent to all the Gates, and that there ſhould be a ſearch made after them without the City until they were found. At the Gate of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne</hi> they diſcover'd his Chair-men, with an ordinary Street Chair, without their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-Coats, which increaſed the ſuſpicion. Being asked where they left their Maſter; they anſwered, That he had commanded them to ſtay for him there, and that he went on foot into the Suburbs. The Guards divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they might purſue their enquiry, and from Houſe to Houſe asked if any body had ſeen ſuch a Marqueſs with ſome other Gentlemen paſs that way. At length a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman ſaid, That he knew not who they meant, but that he had ſeen a Gentleman not long ago go into a Houſe, which he ſhewed them. The Watch entered the Houſe, and knocked at the door where the Marqueſs was, and had upon the firſt noiſe barricado'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The more they prayed him to open, the leſs he anſwered; yet offered no violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed him to be alone, and that having peeped through the Key-hole, they had diſcovered no body in the Chamber but himſelf. Nevertheleſs, upon his refuſing to open the door, and fearing that he might eſcape, they ſet a Guard about the Houſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100358:39"/>until that the Governour ſhould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the matter; but his Lady having prayed her Husband to take horſe likewiſe, he himſelf arrived at the ſame inſtant. He entreated the Marqueſs preſently to open to him; and having heard a confuſed ſaying, Alas! Do it not, we are undone if you open. Brother, ſaid he, I know very well you are within, and that you are not alone; make no reſiſtance, open, and we ſhall take care that your buſineſs may not come to the ears of the King.</p>
               <p>Here the lovely <hi>Clelia</hi> interrupted her ſelf, to tell the Ladies, That <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs himſelf could tell them better than ſhe, in what plight he found himſelf at that time. I know nothing elſe, ſaid ſhe, but that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated with himſelf very long before he made an anſwer. However, perceiving it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to avoid opening the door, and that whether he would or not he muſt obey, if it was ſtill believed that he intended to eſcape with deſign to Fight, he fell at length to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with his Brother-in-law. He told him, That he did not deny but that he was there with one; but that the matter was quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what it was believed; and that he could not do him a greater diskindneſs, than to oblige him to ſhew the perſon that was with him. Brother, ſaid the Governour,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100358:39"/>I promiſe to you, that no body ſhall enter but my ſelf; but alas! he was the perſon of whom the beautiful Mourner was moſt afraid to be ſeen; inſomuch that <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs had no eaſie game to play; however, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to overcome the obſtinacy of his trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Viſitant, by diſcovering to him a Secret, that might engage him to withdraw without ſeeing the Lady. No, Sir, ſaid he, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come in; but promiſe to leave me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, when I have told you who I am with. I ſwear, added he, without giving him leave to anſwer, it is with a Lady. That's no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for me, replied the Governour, who began to be out of patience, you will oblige me at length to make uſe of my Authority; I command you to open this door. At theſe words Monſieur <hi>de Riberville</hi> proteſted that what he ſaid was no falſe pretext. He ſwore, and threatned thoſe that had put that trick upon him, telling the Governour, That by endeavouring to hinder an imaginary Duel, he would ſo ſoon as it was day engage him in a real one, if he could but meet with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Affront. In a word, The poor Gentleman the Marqueſs, uſed his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent his misfortune; but his eagerneſs and paſſion did but haſten it; for the Governour being provoked, cauſed the door to be broken open; and entering into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100358:40"/>by force, he was much amazed when he found no body there but a masked Lady.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> interrupting her, Was that ſame Governour who was ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with the thought that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was gone forth to Fight, ſatisfied to ſee nothing there but Coats, and would not he try if there were no Breeches underneath? That's no part of the Story, replied <hi>Clelia</hi> ſoftly; it is only ſaid that all of them were in great confuſion; the Lady, becauſe ſhe was diſcovered by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Governour, for her diſguiſe had not concealed her; <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs, becauſe he had not been able to prevent the diſgrace; and the Governour, becauſe he had been innocently the cauſe of it. Poor Brother, ſaid he to the Marqueſs, I am very ſenſible that I have come to do you a bad office; but you muſt both quarrel with ſuch a Lady, who came and gave my Wife notice of the Duel, telling her, that you had taken a Couſin of hers for your Second; I ſhould have left you in quiet, had I believed that it was only <hi>her ſhe</hi> inſtead of <hi>he Couſin.</hi> He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged immediately all his Guards not to ſpeak of it, upon pain of being reduced; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that one of theſe Gentlemen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his pleaſure in telling that Story, to his own advantage, or that the Couſin her ſelf took care to make it publick, ſo ſoon as it was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100358:40"/>day, the Adventure was all the Town over. Every one that went to viſit <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, cried to him ſo ſoon as they came within diſtance, Well! Sir, well! Have you parted the Parties engaged as you ought? And in a word, the Raillery laſted above eight days. And this Relation, Ladies, was made where I was preſent, by a Lady of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Evening before we departed from thence, upon our journey hither. Judge then if it be but ſmall danger to love <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, with whom one runs ſuch terrible risks.</p>
               <p>I thought I had been acquainted with a great part of his life, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſieux;</hi> but by what I have juſt now heard, I knew not the beſt intrigue of it. Let me die, ſaid the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> if what the Lady has told us be not an incomparable Story. And beſides, added Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> ſhe has expreſſed all that ſhe ſaid with ſo good a grace, that her Accent alone was able to charm all that heard her. Madam, replied <hi>Clelia, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Marqueſs approves not all the praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you give me. I have good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that my voice hath been a little rude to him whilſt the Story laſted, and you ſee how ſeverely he looks upon me ſtill, becauſe I have told you more News of him than he was willing to hear. Ah! cruel Lady, cried
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100358:41"/>he, having amorouſly beheld her all along; The perſons of whom you have ſpoken, are much more offended than I, at the Relation you have made to theſe Ladies; for I have had the pleaſure at leaſt to hear it told by a lovely mouth, which would even charm me, in pronouncing the ſentence of my death; but I know not what reparation you can make to thoſe two Couſins, who have not the ſame comfort that I have, for the injury you have done them. Ah! Sir, replied ſhe, I have kept my word to you, and have named no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is true, Madam, anſwered he, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the matter is not eaſily gueſſed at, ſince you have named <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> and told that the Lady went to her Aſſignation, whilſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band went to the Palace. But let that paſs; all that I deſign, is to juſtifie the Lady of whom ſome have had the charity to ſay, that it was ſhe that was in the Room with me; for ſeriouſly, not to act the diſcreet Gallant do I ſay this, but that I may contradict a fearful Calumny; it was not ſhe, but a young Client, to whom I had offered the ſmall credit, that upon conſideration of my Siſter I had gained in the Town. The Diſcourſe continued on the ſame Subject, till Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>Kermas</hi> returned into the Parlour, which I told you they had left, that they might take a turn in the Gallery. That
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100358:41"/>Parlour was ſo delightful, by reaſon of the noiſe of ſeveral Fountains and little Caſcades, (which ſeemed to interpoſe and hinder the Sun's entering at the Windows, and falling from thence again into reſervatories, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured along, and mingled themſelves with the other Waters of the Garden) that it was reſolved they ſhould ſpend the heat of the day there; and <hi>Montal</hi> propoſed that the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Dutch</hi> Lady ſhould be obliged to relate the Story ſhe promiſed, whilſt the Company was in the humour of hearing. I am confident, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> that <hi>Kermas</hi> and ſhe have been conſulting together, how they may give a fair gloſs to the Letter which we read before Dinner. If there be a Charm for that, replied the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and ſhe to whom it hath been written, will no doubt invent ſome probable Story to juſtifie her modeſty; but I much ſuſpect it. I need not invent any thing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Velzers,</hi> and you ſhall preſently ſee that they who take upon them to judge of things by appearance, are often raſh in their judgements. Gentlemen and Ladies, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting her, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye engage in any thing, I adviſe you that we muſt go to our Lodging betimes; ye know that my Husband comes purpoſely from <hi>Paris</hi> to ſup with us to night. How? Madam,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100358:42"/>ſaid the Marqueſs, Will you not ſtay at <hi>Vaux</hi> ſome days? do you intend to return to day? Yes, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> the Lady has a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to do ſo; but it is her deſign to have you with her. With all my heart, replied the Marqueſs, provided that that fair young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (looking on <hi>Clelia</hi>) go likewiſe. Both you and ſhe, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> and ye will do us a great honour, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you our Company will be imperfect, and I have a deſign upon you to morrow. The old Governeſs perceiving that her indiſpoſed Lady pleaſed her ſelf much in the Company ſhe was in, did not at all oppoſe the overture; ſhe only ſent a foot-Boy to acquaint her Aunt with it; and afterward all the Company ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about the fair <hi>Hollander</hi> to hear her Story, which in theſe words ſhe began.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Am to tell you a Story wherein I am very much and very little concerned; recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe two if ye can. Laſt Carnaval was a Twelve-month, having gone to the King's great Ball, I ſate near a Young Stranger of a very good Meene, called the Count of <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,</hi> a <hi>Swede;</hi> who had made room for me betwixt himſelf and the <hi>Chevalier de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> becauſe coming too late, the place that was kept for me was taken up. I had there the credit to captivate the Liberty of that Young Count, who eyed me much oftener
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100358:43"/>than the Dancers; and it is ſaid, that all of a ſudden he fell ſo deeply in love with me, when he knew that I was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman, that it was impoſſible for him to live any longer without imparting to me his paſſion. Yet the <hi>Chevalier de la Grancourt</hi> who was one of his Friends, and to whom he confided his deſign as they went out from the Ball, told them, That it was not the Cuſtome of <hi>France</hi> to diſcover Love ſo ſoon; that though I was of a Countrey where Men expreſs themſelves freely enough to Maids, yet I was brought young to this Court, and that it behoved him to court me with the ſame ceremonies that <hi>French</hi> Ladies expect, who deſire that men ſhould ſpend much time in Sighs before they declare their Paſſion. The Young Count with a great deal of regret obeyed him, and to ſay the truth, the poor Soul was burnt alive. He ſought then all occaſions to be where I was; at places where Ladies met for Play: at Comedies, whereof I was pretty fond; at Balls, and in a word in all places, where <hi>La Grancourt</hi> who put theſe follies in his head, made him believe I might be; in ſo much, that for the ſpace of above two months whereſoever I was I ſaw no body but him, not knowing that his deſign was on me. In fine, one Evening about the end of the Spring, when I took the Air at <hi>Rombouillet,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100358:43"/>with ſeveral Gentlemen and Ladies, I was quite amazed to ſee a Conſort of Four and Twenty Viols and Violins, come and give us a Serenade; and as we asked one another who it was intended for, we heard a Voice ſing ſome Verſes wherein I was named, which convinced all the Company that it was onely deſigned for me. The Gentlemen that were with us ran immediately to that Voice, that they might learn who gave the Serenade; but the Muſick not knowing themſelves who it was that employed them, anſwered onely, That they were ordered to play ſo long as I pleaſed, and that they were payed for the whole Night. Then all the Company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that we muſt dance; and one of theſe Gentlemen would have taken me out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Ball; but I was ſo enraged at the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was taken, to name me in the Song; that taking him who came to deſire my hand, for the author of that rude Frolick, I diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſed it him; however it behoved me to dance, and patiently bear all that was ſaid to me upon the account of my Gallant whom I knew not. Afterward I lived quietly more than ſix Weeks without further news; but in fine, the <hi>Swede</hi> ſent me a melting Note, with a moſt rich <hi>German</hi> Cabinet; which in my abſence was brought to our houſe, and which four hours after the <hi>Chevalier de la Grancourt</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100358:44"/>came to redemand, ſaying, That there was a miſtake committed, and that it was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me. However, my Father who had already read the Note, though he was ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee it conceived in terms of Love ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what particular, would reſtore nothing until he had ſpoken with me. Neither did he give back the Cabinet untill that the <hi>Swede</hi> came to our houſe, and told him, That he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in writing my Name, for another that ſounded like it. Yet all. that hindered not but that my Father took a more narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into my actions than was uſual to him. Now I'le tell you the myſtery of the riddle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Grancourt,</hi> famous enough for many Tricks of Wit that he hath played, and which another than my ſelf would perhaps call by another name; having found occaſion to make a Fop of this Stranger, perſwaded him to give me the Serenade; which, as I told you, I received in <hi>Rombouillet,</hi> and to make to me, the day following, a declaration of his Love in Writing, which he offered to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for him; for it was the <hi>Chevalier de la Grancourt</hi> that framed the Letter which ye have read, and another which ye are ſtill to read, and whereby the poor <hi>Swede</hi> thought that he daily diſcovered to me his paſſion. The Count onely tranſcribed them, becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100358:44"/>he knew no more but to caſt a baſtard Letter. And ye ſhall ſee, ſaid ſhe, pulling out of her pocket a Pacquet of Letters and Notes, in what manner that impertinent Chevalier made me anſwer in the Letters that he wrote in my name. I brought with me all theſe fooleries with a deſign to divert you with them as being a noveltie; and to inform you of that egregious Cheat. With theſe words plucking one of theſe Letters out of the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, <hi>Here,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>is his firſt declaration of Love.</hi>

               <p>Pretty Girl that I was! continued ſhe, and for what a ſtrange Piece would <hi>la Grancourt</hi> have had me taken? All they who give ſuch anſwers, ſaid the Marqueſs, are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and it is natural enough for a civil Maid to declare her ſelf that way. Ha! Sir, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> I am your humble Servant, and differ much from your opinions; the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> was quite out; for though we were the moſt amorous things in the World, we confeſs it not ſo openly. I believe that of you very well, replied he roguiſhly, (becauſe that Lady was ſuſpected to be ſecretly in love with a Perſon of great quality, to whom it was believed ſhe was married;) but all the reſt of your Sex are not like you. Diſpute that at another time, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I have not too much time to make an end of my Story in.</p>
               <p>The poor Stranger was ſo overjoyed, when he received ſo favourable an Anſwer, that I was told he was a long time tranſported, like a fool, not knowing what he did. A thouſand times he embraced the Chevalier <hi>de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> for the good counſel that he had given
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100358:46"/>him, and attributed my good inclinations, to the little civilities that he was perſwaded by him to ſhew me. He proteſted never to have another Confident but him, and never to write nor ſpeak but what he did dictate. And here I pray you obſerve the ſtupidity of this poor man, in imagining, though he could hardly ſmatter, and buy and ſell in <hi>French,</hi> that I ſhould believe that all theſe gallant Letters were his own. But <hi>la Grancourt</hi> knew very well what Sow he had by the ear, and ſeeking one that might defray part of his expences, he had good reaſon to caſt his eyes on him. In the mean time he wrote to me a ſecond Note, which ye ſhall hear, and which is a piece of Gallantry not to be matched; for in it I was no leſs than Mount <hi>Etna,</hi> to which a Shepherd directed his Diſcourſe. And this perhaps that fool <hi>la Grancourt</hi> compoſed, becauſe the other had entertained ſuch a fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montal,</hi> who from the beginning of the Story had very familiarly fallen aſleep, though he appeared to be one of the moſt concerned, to hear the Juſtification of Madamoiſelle <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> awoke briskly at this time, when the fancy of Mount <hi>Etna</hi> made the Company laugh a little. And imagining that they laughed at him; Pardon me, ſaid he, ſtill very drowſie; that lovely <hi>Hollander</hi> with the ſweetneſs of her voice lulls me aſleep. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100358:46"/>added he, I have very well heard that ye were ſpeaking of a Note, and of Mount <hi>Etna,</hi> and I have not loſt ſo much as one word of the Diſcourſe. But for all that, Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> failed not to tell him, that it was a great ſhame to ſleep amongſt Ladies; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, drolling likewiſe, ſaid very pleaſantly, If he ſleep by day, Ladies, judge what he can do by night. But <hi>Velzers,</hi> who knew very well that ſhe had ſomewhat that would puzzle him, thought it enough to give him the Note, that he might read and explain it. And he having a little rubbed his eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with this title.</p>

               <p>All the Company were ready to ſplit with laughter, to ſee the amazement wherewith <hi>Montal</hi> read that admirable Note; and in truth it was a Riddle for him who had not heard the beginning of the Story. But at length looking on Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> with an odd kind of ſerious aſpect; S'lid! ſaid he, Madamoiſelle, If you be that civil diſcreet <hi>Mount,</hi> the things he ſpeaks of are indeed pretty neat things: A man that writes to you in that ſtrain, muſt needs have acted a fair Part with you; and it is indeed an excellent way to juſtifie the Letter we ſaw not long ago, to bring out ſtill new Billets of this nature. He had no other anſwer, but a continued Fit of laughter, until that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> ſpake again and ſaid; That <hi>Swede</hi> muſt needs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100358:47"/>have had as little wit as reaſon, in ſending ſuch a piece of Folly to a perſon whom he loved, the ſecond time that he wrote to her. Good, good! replied Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> A man who underſtood not <hi>French,</hi> might take that Note for one of the fineſt things in the World, and it was enough for him that he found Mount <hi>Etna</hi> in it; do you think that he minded any thing elſe? For the reſt he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt.</hi> That Villain, ſaid the Marqueſs, purſued his ſport too far, and told fine tales of it afterward amongſt his Friends, I'll warrant you. Not amongſt his Friends, replied Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> but to a Miſtreſs of his own, whom he had long enriched at the coſt of ſuch Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; for ye muſt know that ſhe had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a vaſt number of Preſents, which the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> perſwaded that Stranger to make to me, and that I am to tell you in due time. It was a commodious fetch, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux. La Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> never ſubſiſted but by Fops, added the Marqueſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swede</hi> then, continued <hi>Velzers,</hi> ſent me that goodly Note, or it was his intention at leaſt. And ſeeing the Chevalier <hi>de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> upon occaſion, ſet me out for a witty Maid, for a pretty little nibler at Poetry too, if that was wanting, and in a word, for every

               <p>You muſt obſerve, <hi>continued Velzers,</hi> that the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> made me pray the Stranger to take in good part that I made as if I had no commerce with him, for fear we ſhould have ſpoilt all if we came roge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Indeed, my indifferency would have clearly convinced him, that he was played upon; but ſeeing he believed I did but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, my imaginary conſtraint, as they ſay, made him more amorous, than if I had ſpoken to him with all the tenderneſs of affection. This rage of writing laſted a whole month, during which he ceaſed not to admire my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Wit which appeared in many ſuch Notes; but never durſt for all that turn his Eyes to the place where I was. The more he was ſeen to affect that ſtayedneſs, the more I was made to take notice of it in all places where we met together, yea and when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I had a mind in raillery to ask him the reaſon, he withdrew, and made ſigns to me with his eyes, whereat I was not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. But at length, my Lover grew weary of making love only by Tickets and Billets; wherefore finding me one time at St. <hi>Germans</hi> alone in the Queens Anti-Chamber, through which I was going to the Lodgings of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Montauſter;</hi> he ſtopt me, and made ſuch impertinent diſcourſes, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not in the leaſt, being ignorant of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100358:49"/>tricks of <hi>La Grancourt:</hi> and made ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propoſitions to me, under the name of his <hi>Mount Etna;</hi> that I was forced to flie out in paſſion and take him up with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſharpneſs.</p>
               <p>In the heat of this Jangling, as he accuſed me of inconſtancy, I aſſured him that I never wrote to men, and that they who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him Letters in my name, had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited them, and intended onely to put a trick upon him; this had very near broken all the meaſures which the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> had taken; for my <hi>Swede</hi> underſtood not raillery. He went immediately to upbraid him for the Cheat, and to tell him that he intended to ſee him with his Sword in hand: which would not have a little intangled the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> who ſtood upon his honour, if he had not made his bravery yield to the deſire he had of preſerving ſo beneficial a Fop. But ye ſhall hear the courſe he took. Having anſwered in higher terms than had been uſed to him, and made a thouſand Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domantado's as to the Challenge, he told the Count, That he knew no reaſon why I had been ſo ill to him; but that ſo ſoon as he had informed himſelf of the matter, and juſtified his own proceedings, he ſhould be willing to fight, yea and to urge him to decide it with the firſt opportunity. Upon this both ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100358:49"/>the <hi>Swede</hi> went to his Lodgings, and <hi>La Grancourt</hi> made haſte to make me write a lovely Letter, which next morning he ſent to him by my Chamber-Maid; that Slut was in the Plot to cheat me: And in this manner the Chevalier made me ſpeak in that Letter.</p>

You had almoſt undone me by ſpeaking to me in the Old Palace of St.</hi> German. <hi>And if Madam</hi> de Choiſi, <hi>who heard us behind the next doore, were not one of the diſcreeteſt and beſt Ladies of the Court, there would be ſtrange diſcourſes made of me; and the carriage that I affected towards you, would not ſecure me from cenſure. I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have believed that you would have been ſo imprudent as to talk to me of our ſecrets, in thoſe places where the very Walls have ears; I confeſs the rage which that weak action occaſion'd, drew from me many offenſive expreſſions. However, I immediately repented what I had done; becauſe I am not pleas'd to ſee you ſuffer; and what I tell you is ſo true, that I have wept for it all night
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100358:50"/>long. I beg my dear Coûnt, that you pardon the trouble I have given you, and in revenge deſire of me what you pleaſe, my Love ſhall grant you every thing that poſſibly can make amends for my Cruelty.</hi>

               <p>The Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> who always nickt his opportunities, came to the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Lodgings immediately after my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Maid had delivered her Meſſage, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſtill much indifferency, told him that he came to wait upon him to the houſe of a Lady where I was to be, that he might ask me the reaſon of the laſt adventure. But the poor Fop who was by my Letter more than ever confirmed in his fancies, embraced the Cheat with great expreſſion of kindneſs, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to excuſe the weakneſs of a Lover who was deceived by appearances; and having with much ado won him again, conſulted with him what anſwer was beſt to be made to that Letter, being reſolved to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to purpoſe, by the demands which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to make to me. The Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> adviſed him at firſt not to let ſlip ſo fair an occaſion of obtaining ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. There is nothing like it, ſaid he, to engage Ladies that way; And having made as if he conſidered with himſelf what demand was fitteſt to be made to me, he concluded at
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100358:50"/>length that it was beſt to oblige me to grant a private interview, in what place I pleaſed to chooſe; which I was inſtantly acquainted with by this other Note adorned with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs which ſhews it to be of ſome worth; for the Direction is; <hi>To the moſt Cruel of all Beauties.</hi>

But I ſhall never pardon the wrong which that fair Mouth hath done me, unleſs it be deſired by the ſame Lips; for ſeeing I muſt tell you ſo, I truſt no more to Paper, ſince the time you ſo cruelly maintained that you had never written to me, And I ſhall never believe that I have

               <p>To ſpeak the truth, ſaid Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne,</hi> that ſame <hi>La Grancourt</hi> made a great fool of the poor <hi>Swede.</hi> The Story requires, (continued Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi>) that to be as good as my word I ſhould give him the meeting that he deſired, and that becauſe of my Father, who made me cloſely to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; (which was the leaſt thing however in the good Man's thoughts) I ſhould find no better Expedient than to make my Galant at Midnight come under the Balcony of my Anti-Chamber, which lay in an open place off of the Street, and by throwing down a Silken Ladder to bring him that way into my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. And you muſt know, if you pleaſe, that this was done. My honeſt Chamber-Maid promiſed to the Chevalier <hi>de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> to appear on the Balcony, and to throw down that Ladder, on condition that he ſhould invent ſome trick at the inſtant that the Stranger intended to get up, that might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from effectuating his deſign; but the luck was, that the deſign was other wayes, and by other people interrupted.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100358:51"/>
               <p>The Coach of Monſieur <hi>de Soyecourt</hi> was coming that way, at the very nick when the Gallant was upon the Ladder; and the Torches having made light enough in the open place, to give occaſion to the Son of the Marqueſs of <hi>Maucomble,</hi> who came immediately after in a Chair, to obſerve that Scalado, the young Gentleman ſtopped, cried out Thieves, laid hold on my Gallant who was in diſguiſe, and put him in the Officers hands, who carried him to priſon, the poor Lover not daring all the while to name himſelf, nor to make his juſtification, for fear of undoing my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Obſerve a little how great obligations I had to him; greater than you are aware of, ſaid <hi>Montal;</hi> and 'tis well he be not as much obliged to you. To me? anſwered ſhe; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he is: Have you not ſeen very well by the Letter that was read not long ago, that he had all he deſired of me? You jeſt, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> or otherways it has been the ſame way that you wrote all theſe Notes to him, to wit, by a third perſon. Ha! anſwered coldly the lovely <hi>Hollander,</hi> I think that is to be underſtood, and my looks give you no ground to judge otherways. 'Y faith! ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> the looks are nothing, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accompliſhed my deſigns on any with greater eaſe, than on thoſe who cry out, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when men ſpeak to them of Love. And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100358:52"/>that is the reaſon, replied ſhe inconcernedly ſtill, that you apply your ſelf to me; do but perſiſt, and you'll be ſure to gain your point. Well underſtood, continued he; do you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine then that you love me not already? La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſaid he, directing his Diſcourſe to the Company, This is one of the moſt diſſembling Maids in the World; for though ſhe ſeem to you ſo chaſte, ſo diſdainful and inexorable, yet it is only becauſe we have complotted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that I complain of her cruelty, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the curious, and I will not tell all that we two have done by our ſelves. At theſe words ſhe grew ſo red, that the Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving her vexed, were very angry with <hi>Montal;</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> amongſt others, told him, that ſhe took no pleaſure in ſuch kind of familiarities; not but that ſhe knew very well, that among good Friends they might be ſometimes uſed in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; but becauſe we may very frequently meet with perſons, whoſe humour hath no ſympathy with our own, and that making no difference of thoſe to whom we ſpeak, we give occaſion to ſuch fooliſh heads, to interpret things according to their own reach: Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, Chevalier, ſaid the Marqueſs, you are a little too free; or to ſay better, you are one of thoſe great Talkers, who to appear Wits and Gallants, know not for moſt part what
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100358:52"/>they ſay. How? Are you againſt me too? replied <hi>Montal.</hi> Upon my faith! for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſhall be ſo diſcreet and reſerved, that ye ſhall twenty times entreat me to ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I open my mouth. That is indeed as much as he can do, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> ſmiling, (to ſhew that ſhe was not vexed;) but I will not deſiſt from telling my Story.</p>
               <p>Ye know, continued ſhe, the rumour that was ſpread laſt Winter, that there was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made to rob us in the night-time. Yes, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> It was ſaid that there were Daggers, and Cords with nooſes found in the Balcony, with which ye were all to have been killed, and it was all the Town-talk at <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet for all that there was no deſign againſt my life, replied Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>Velzers;</hi> the Robber was but my Gallant, who, as I told you, was caſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and next day anſwered to his Charge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a borrowed Name, for the ſame reaſons that hindered him the Night before from naming himſelf. Alas! ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> he did not deſerve to be ſo gull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed. <hi>Montal</hi> that great Caviller would not have done ſo much, ſaid Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>Velzers.</hi> At theſe words he was about to ſpeak again; but the thought of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe checked him ſo pleaſantly that that was worth all that he could have ſaid; and in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100358:53"/>mean time ſhe went on in this manner:</p>
               <p>The Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt,</hi> who loſt no occaſion of making his own advantage at the coſt of the <hi>Swede,</hi> made a very dextrous uſe of that opportunity, to fleece him of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of money; and having agreed with the Officers for a ſmall matter to ſet him at liberty, he told him that it would coſt him a thouſand pounds, and put nine hundred of them in his pocket. Ha! It was that money then, ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting her, that put him laſt Winter in ſo rich an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. That may very well be, replied ſhe; but however, ſo ſoon as the poor Priſoner was at liberty, he began again to ſend me Notes; and I wave a great many of them, that I may ſhew you the pleaſanteſt of all, which is this.</p>

               <p>This then is at length the Note which your Father received, ſaid the Marqueſs. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame, anſwered ſhe; at leaſt it is the blurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paper which came to my hands with the other Letters. Well, to the purpoſe then, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> How came they to your hands? That you ſhall know in due time, replied the fair <hi>Hollander;</hi> I have ſomething elſe to tell you firſt. Good now! ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> before ſhe enter again into her Relation, will ſome body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to me what is the meaning of a Symbole of Matrimony; this term ſeems to me very pleaſant, though I underſtand it not. Ah! Madam, You have too much wit, replied the Marqueſs, not to underſtand the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. I ſwear to you, anſwered ſhe, that I know not in the leaſt what it ſignifies. But, Madamoiſelle, replied he, how could that way of ſpeaking then have pleaſed you? How now! ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> interrupting him briskly, and being weary of ſilence, Perceive you not very well, that it is becauſe the Symbole of Marriage and Concubinage is one and the ſame thing? O the impudent man! replied immediately, Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> laughing and bluſhing both together, He only held his peace thus long, that he might watch an occaſion to tell me ſuch a Foppery. I am mad, continued he, to hear ſo many words
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100358:54"/>ſpent about a trifle. Why a Devil do not you rather let us come to an end of our Story? Come on, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> he has reaſon. Obſerve then; and thus ſhe proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted her Diſcourſe:</p>
               <p>That was the incomparable Note which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the <hi>German</hi> Cabinet that the <hi>Swede</hi> ſent me; and that ye may underſtand this part of the Story, ye muſt know that the reaſon why he wrote to me in that wonderful Jargon, was becauſe he had ſeen me prize that Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net much in the Fair. And having bought it, with a deſign to ſend it to my Lodgings before I could return, he choſe rather to write to me the beſt way he could, that he might accompany his Preſent with a Note, than to expect his Secretary who was gone to St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> It was blockiſhly and heedleſly done; but his imprudence did him no great hurt, and the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> was the great Maſter that ſet all things to rights again. The latter however was much ſurprized, when at his return he learnt that the Cabinet was ſent to me. And when he underſtood that my. Father would not return it back, unleſs the Author of the Note came, and gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it in his preſence, it was ſaid, that there never was a man ſo out of countenance as that Cheat; for he was afraid that if his Fop came to our Lodgings, he might diſcover
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100358:54"/>how much he had abuſed him. However, I have told you how he came off at that time. He made him believe that I was undone, if he did not come and tell my Father that he was miſtaken, and deny that he directed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet for me. By this means he ſhunned the Information, got back the Cabinet, and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next day a Letter, wherein I ordered the poor Lover to cauſe his Preſent to be carried to a certain Houſe; the Chevalier <hi>de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> being in correſpondence with the people of that Houſe, ſeized it, and made a Preſent of it to his Miſtreſs. In the mean time I was no leſs aſtoniſhed upon my return home, to find my Father out of humour; and I could hardly perſwade him that I was innocent, by telling him that that Stranger was a Fool, and had taken a fancy that I was in love with him. I told him the Complement he made me in the Queens Anti-Chamber; the ſigns that he gave me that I ſhould not be ſo familiar with him, when I had a mind to laugh at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies that ſometimes he told me; and in fine, the entreaty that one of his Friends made to me to divert my ſelf with him on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and out of pity not to contradict him; for, ſaid I to my Father, it is ſaid, that ſuch kind of Blades are not to be exaſperated; and as for the Cabinet, he ſent it to me, becauſe he ſaw me prize it in the Fair. But, ſaid
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100358:55"/>Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting her, you took him really then for a Fool? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truer, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers;</hi> I was ſo well perſwaded of it, that I accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Friends to entertain the ſame opinion. And beſides, the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> himſelf helpt to confirm me in it, telling me, that it was the folly of that poor man to fancy that Women loved him. O! the Impoſtor, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> can any man be more cruelly impoſed upon? But, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe, how came you to diſcover all that Myſtery? Truly, anſwered the <hi>Hollander,</hi> we are not come to that yet; and there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a great many other Adventures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could come to the knowledge of any thing.</p>
               <p>After the buſineſs of the Cabinet, the Count of <hi>Valdame</hi> whom I took to be a Fool, made Courtſhip to me, for the ſpace of a month at leaſt, with tranquillity enough, and I allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that he ſaid he had done for me, and that I had done for him, becauſe I conſidered him as fantaſtical. But, in fine, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inheritance recalled my Father to <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and it behoved me to go along with him. Ye are now to hear of fearful matters that happened on occaſion of that Journey, and whilſt we continued there. In the firſt place, Before we departed, I ſaw my poor
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100358:55"/>diſtreſſed Lover ſhed floods of tears, which might have perhaps affected me, if another beſides himſelf had teſtified ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the conceit that I had of his folly, was a guard to my diſcretion, againſt all the aſſaults of commiſeration, and the more he wept, the more I laughed. I had all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the World to hinder him from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to <hi>Holland;</hi> and I am perſwaded that without this valedictory Letter, wherein I diſcharged him to attempt it, nothing could ever have taken him off of it; it was made up under a Cover with the ordinary Direction, <hi>For</hi> Monſieur <hi>the Count of</hi> Valdame; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Letter it ſelf were theſe tender and ſweet qualities, <hi>To the moſt amiable and moſt affectionate Lover, from the moſt afflicted and beſt beloved of all Women.</hi> And I believe that that was written with a Chickens Blood; the Contents of it were as you ſhall hear.</p>

Right, anſwered <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers;</hi> I was ſo much enamoured in the Letters of the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt,</hi> that I obſerved no bounds nor meaſures. And that was therefore the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he ſtayed willingly in <hi>France,</hi> untill,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100358:56"/>that three Weeks ago I came back, in the company of Monſieur the Chevalier, ſaid ſhe, pointing to <hi>Montal.</hi> But tell me, <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, had he already ſhared any way in your favour when you made that Journey? that is true, anſwered ſhe, and I forgot the beſt of all; yes, yes, he was already perſwaded that I had uſed him kindly, and the order of the Hiſtory requires, that I ſhould have granted him all that he could deſire of me, before there was a word ſpoken of our departure. But admire a little, if you pleaſe, the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt,</hi> and to what pleaſant acknowledgments of thanks he expoſed me, next day after he had given him one in my place; for it was in ſequel of that rare adventure that he wrote the Letter which this morning was likely to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done my honour and reputation. But how came it, ſaid the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> that he perceived not the change? Sir, replied ſhe, pardon me, if I give you no reaſon for that. I am not ſufficiently acquainted with the ceremonies which are obſerved in ſuch rancounters, to ſatisfie your curioſity. All that I can tell you is, That next day he ſeemed raviſhed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſures which, as he ſaid, I had afforded him, and which were Hebrew to me who knew not all the myſtery. But, added Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100358:57"/>
                  <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> how and which way could he think that you could come to ſuch an aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lye abroad? Good God, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers,</hi> have you not heard as often as I, that love is ingenious in flattering it ſelf, and thinks nothing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? To give every thing its due, ſaid the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> if it be true, that imagination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces our ſweet pleaſures, <hi>La Grancourt</hi> by that trick cheated the Stranger but in one half. Theſe pleaſures, replied ſhe, coſt him dear, during my ſtay at <hi>Middlebourg;</hi> and I queſtion not but <hi>Monſieur</hi> his Confident pumpt out of his purſe above Ten thouſand Crowns, under pretext of Trafficking for me. Is it poſſible? ſaid the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> again in great amazement. I tell you nothing but what is both poſſible and true, anſwered ſhe: And obſerve, if you pleaſe, how that Knave accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his deſign.</p>
               <p>The firſt Letter that he wrote in my name to that poor Fop, amongſt many Proteſtations of eternal conſtancy in my love, contained a noſt earneſt ſute, that he would chuſe for me one of the fineſt ſuits of hangings that was to be found at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſend me the price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent the hangings, that I might with all expedition order the money to be paid in to him. To write ſo to ſuch a Lover as he,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100358:57"/>was as much as to have ſaid, Give it me gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. Nor did he fail to do it, and having entruſted his Chevalier with the ſending of it; (for this faithful Friend had gained ſo much on his mind, that without his counſel he could do nothing.) The Voyage of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie into <hi>Holland</hi> ended at the houſe of this Cheats Miſtriſs, where ſhe likewiſe found the <hi>German</hi>-Cabinet. He provided this Slut alſo of a Bed of Crimſon Damask, with Gold and Silver Fringes, which coſt him as much as the Tapiſtrie, and gave her for apparel pieces of the fineſt Stuffs that were ever made in <hi>France.</hi> I know not, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſieux,</hi> what end this will come to; but I think <hi>La Grancourt</hi> hath done a great deal not to be diſcovered, and not to have given the <hi>Swede</hi> ground of ſuſpition. He never wanted good Precepts, replied <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers,</hi> to make me deſire all theſe things; but at length, ſeeing it would be difficult, that upon my return into <hi>France</hi> the cheat ſhould not be found out; can ye imagine, do ye think, what Plot he contrived? My poor Lover had ſworn to him a thouſand times, that he loved me with ſo violent a paſſion, that if I ſhould chance to die, he would poyſon himſelf that he might not ſurvive the loſs of me. <hi>La Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> imagining that ſo paſſionate a Lover would keep his word to him, reſolved to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100358:58"/>me die in fancie, that ſo by a noble deſpair, he might eaſe himſelf of any further trouble in bringing the Play to its Cataſtrophe. To this end, he makes me write that I found my ſelf indiſpoſed; To which the <hi>Swede</hi> made ſuch affectionate anſwers; that it would break your heart, ſhould I but read them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Knave ſent him Letters whereby a third perſon at my direction, gave him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the progreſs of my diſtemper, and amongſt others there was one which touched him ſo feelingly, that to the great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Chevalier de la Grancourt,</hi> he came one day booted and ſpurr'd to the Lodging of his faithful Confident, to take his leave of him, being reſolved at what rate ſoever to come ſee me at <hi>Middlebourg.</hi> What trouble has a Cheat to find remedies for ſo many emergents! cried <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux.</hi> Knavery and Envy are like one another, ſaid the Marqueſs, they carry about with them their own puniſhment. <hi>La Grancourt</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf fallen from his height, continued <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers,</hi> when he found the <hi>Swede</hi> ſo reſolved on that deſign; and for his greater perplexity, the Lover was got on horſeback, and all his Servants with him, and he durſt not leave him ſo much as a quarter of an hour, to go write him Orders in my name not to depart. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100358:58"/>Grancourt</hi> having bethought himſelf a little, pretended at length that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to <hi>Holland,</hi> and having perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to alight that he might reſt a little at his Lodgings, whilſt his own Horſe was making ready, he begg'd leave to go ſpeak a word or two to a Friend that lived hard by: but that was to frame a Letter written with my own hand, wherein I aſſured him that I was in the way of recovery, and that for his better aſſurance, we ſhould ſhortly ſee one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other again. The <hi>Chevalier de la Grancourt</hi> returning, a little after he had cauſed the Letter to be delivered to him, pretended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf delightfully ſurprized, upon ſight of it, and having given God thanks for my cure, found no more difficulty to put a ſtop to the Journey. And thus he alſo awarded that laſt blow. But all this increaſing onely the fear he had of being at ſome time or other diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, made him alſo without compaſſion haſten the hour of my death; and here is the fatal Letter by which, eight dayes after, I made it known to my poor Lover, at that very time when he ſwore moſt deeply never to ſurvive me, and had his <hi>Opium</hi> always by him; ſo that <hi>La Grancourt</hi> was already contriving how to order his Funeral, ſo ſoon as he had read the Letter.</p>

                        <hi>OUR Deſtiny, my dear Count, ſuffers me not to ſee you again, and I am ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by my Sickneſs within theſe four dayes, that there is nothing ſurer than that I muſt die before an end be made of this Letter. I well foreſee that this troubleſome News which you expected not, will aſſault you with cruel thoughts: and that as I would not think of living if you died before me, ſo I make no doubt but my death will put you into horrible deſpair .... Alas! were it true that Lovers United again below; I ſhould not ſo much lament to die .... Farewell my dear Count, I can dictate no more, Grief and Sobs ſtop my mouth. I have given Orders that this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be not ſent to you, untill I be dead. I die wholly yours, and the moſt Faithful of all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>

               <p>The Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> had added alſo theſe words in trembling Characters; Farewel the moſt beloved that ever ſhall be, to the end that the Count for grief or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways might the more ſpeedily depart this life. But, continued ſhe, laughing, it is probable that the <hi>Swedes</hi> like all other men, think not themſelves obliged to keep their promiſe to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100358:59"/>the dead. My Lover was ſo far from killing himſelf, had hardly a quarter of an hour ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lamented his loſs, but amongſt a great many cares that afflicted him, he asked if he ſhould likewiſe loſe the Money he had payed for the Hangings, and whether my Father would not re-imburſe it him; at which <hi>la Grancourt</hi> was ſo amazed, that he was ready to have died in his place. I believe it very well, ſaid the Marqueſs, laughing heartily; for that was a rough Bruſh for his cunning. Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> alſo and all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laughed at it; but ſtill with a great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and with a moral reflexion on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change of the <hi>Swede.</hi> Traiterous men! cryed ſhe; and after all this can it be ſaid, that there is any man worth a Ruſh? Good now! replied the fair <hi>Hollander,</hi> let me make an end. I am not at all ſurprized at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and we muſt not expect that theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are ſo heroical, as to die gloriouſly for us. They would be great Fools to do ſo, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> and far greater ſtill if they did it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, rather than before the death of that which they love. And when would you have them do it then, ſaid the Marqueſs? I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if any one ſhould die of deſpair, it ſhould be when he has for ever loſt that which was deareſt to him. That is a Tale of a Tub, replied <hi>Montal;</hi> for Deſire being dead with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100358:60"/>the Object, we come to our wits again; and as the living are made for the living, we let the dead go, for another that can eat and drink. So then, I ſhould truſt much to you, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> if I intended to have a Gallant. How, to me? replied he, I am the moſt conſtant Lover in the World; I was like to have killed my ſelf ten times for the cruelties of my Miſtreſs; and that fair One, (looking on Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi>) was a witneſs of it in <hi>Holland.</hi> Yes verily, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, drolling, it was that was the cruel Miſtreſs. Yes, yes! ſweet Laugher, replied he, it was you; and you know that there was many times much ado to hinder me, from falling into the folly of poyſoning my ſelf; but I ſhall have a care for the future, and the greater after your death, than at another time. You need not ſwear to make me believe it, ſaid ſhe, looking ſomewhat coldly upon him. Madamoiſelle, replied he, to ſweeten what he had ſaid, Perhaps ſeeing I love you with extraordinary paſſion, the firſt ſhock of my grief would bring me to a natural death; but, continued he, looking on the Company with his uſual Drollery, Be aſſured, I would not kill my ſelf, and it is not the faſhion now adays for men to ſtab themſelves for Love. But what reaſon have you, anſwered the Marqueſs, to be willing rather to kill your
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100358:60"/>ſelf before, than after? Ha, ha! replied <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> What reaſon have I? When we muſt often ſee a Woman, with whom we are deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love, the Object moving our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Love provoked by denials, making us mad, we may ſometimes prefer poiſon to ſo uneaſie a life; but remove all hopes of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon, (which can only be done by death) and we come to our right wits again. That is a good reaſon for a brutiſh Fellow, who might love a Woman ſenſually, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but for a vertuous Gentleman — Good God! ſaid he, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her, I know what you are about to ſay; but ye would be all fairly lurched, if men loved you only like Angels; and when we hear ſuch Preachments of the ſpirituality of Love, all are but conceits to lay us in the Cradle. Ah! replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> I maintain that there are ſome men, who love with the greateſt honeſty imaginable, and without any deſign. And for my part, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, I maintain that that is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. They pretend perhaps more honeſty than others, but that is only to bait the hook, and it is a way that never fails. Ladies, then ſaid the Marqueſs, If we believe his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, there will be no commerce betwixt the two Sexes, but what muſt be very dangerous. You play the Wag, ſaid <hi>Montal</hi> to him, but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100358:61"/>you underſtand me not. Well, well, be gone, replied the Marqueſs; neither theſe Ladies nor I will hear you any longer; and we had rather that Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> would tell us, how the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> got out of the mire wherein we left him ſticking.</p>
               <p>How he got out? anſwered ſhe. Two days after that he fought a Duel with a man that killed him; otherwiſe I believe he had never come off with credit. It is not long then ſince that happened, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux;</hi> for it is no more than three weeks ſince the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> was killed. You may eaſily imagine that it is of freſh date, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> ſeeing I told you that it is but three weeks ſince I returned from <hi>Holland;</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> was killed but two days before. Yet I believe, continued ſhe, that had he lived longer, he would have found out ſome new invention to have rid himſelf of his man. And he had even begun another Stratagem to bring things ſo about, that the <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould depart from <hi>Paris,</hi> and give him up all the Letters which he fancied he had received from me. He told him, that if my Father made the leaſt difficulty, to repay the Money that the Moveables coſt, the only way to bring the old Man to reaſon, would be to threaten to publiſh the Letters of his deceaſed Daughter.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100358:61"/>However the ſucceſs of that Intrigue was ſo uncertain, and the conſequences of it would have proved ſo intricate, that I aſſure you the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> did far better to find a way to be killed, than to truſt to it. But if his death relieved him from trouble, it wrought vexation enough to my Father and me, ſo ſoon as we returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> Two days after, the Stranger came, and in his own language which my Father underſtands very well, condoled with him for my death. To which my Father, who was poſſeſſed with the thought that the poor man was a Fool, and that one muſt ſeem to believe all his fancies, made anſwer, as if it had been true that I was dead. This he could the more eaſily do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Lady one of our Friends, had detained me at her Houſe, as we paſſed that way, and being not as yet arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> I could not by my preſence falſifie his Diſcourſe. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered alſo the fancy of the <hi>Swede,</hi> as a means to deliver me at length from an importunate Fool, and believing that all he ſaid of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry and Damask-Bed, for which he deſired back his Money, was ſuch another Dream as that of my Death: That he might not anger him, he gave him likewiſe anſwer, That he expected Bills of Exchange, and that ſo ſoon as they were come, he ſhould have his Money. The Stranger came ſeveral times to ask news
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100358:62"/>of the Bills of Exchange, until that being put off almoſt fifteen days, and loſing patience, he at length ſent another <hi>Swede,</hi> to tell my Father that he could wait no longer; that perſons of our quality never wanted a thouſand or twelve hundred pieces, which he deſired only to be payed off; that he ſtood in need of them for his Journey into <hi>Swedeland;</hi> and that to be ſhort, he muſt needs have his Money. My Father that knew the other <hi>Swede</hi> very well, whoſe Name was Monſieur <hi>de Gruſtaw,</hi> and who had only taken upon him that Meſſage, becauſe he was a Friend of ours, as well as of the Count of <hi>Valdame</hi>'s, at firſt played upon his credulity, for having taken all the fancies of the Count for real truths; he alſo laughed heartily to ſee him in the ſame miſtake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Amours, inſomuch that never poor man was more aſtoniſhed than Monſieur <hi>de Gruſtaw.</hi> On the one hand he conſidered that my Father ſcorned baſeneſs; on the other ſide he had never found any folly in the Count of <hi>Valdame;</hi> and being forced to entertain bad thoughts of both, for a long time he could not tell what to ſay. Nevertheleſs, being fully perſwaded by my Father, that the Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was hypocondriack, my imaginary death, and my pretended Letters, which were not of my writing, the Relation of the Carriers, who had carried no Furniture into <hi>Holland,</hi> at
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100358:62"/>the time and with the mark that the <hi>Swede</hi> mentioned, and a thouſand other as probable circumſtances, having ſufficiently convinced <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> that the Count was crackt; and that beſides that, he had not ſeen him for the ſpace of a year, in leſs than which one may turn Fool. He excuſed himſelf to my Father for having undertaken the Commiſſion; and ſhewing himſelf much afflicted for the poor Gentleman's misfortune, he took his leave, returning to the Count again. And here comes in the pleaſanteſt Adventure of all; for the Count having earneſtly enquired what ſucceſs he had had in his Negotiation, <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> believing him to be a Fool, obſerved the ſame meaſures, as my Father had done in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. He told him that he ſhould not in the leaſt diſquiet himſelf, becauſe my Father was a man of Honour, that would certainly do him right as to his Money. And in the mean while he prayed him to go take a little reſt; asked him if he ſlept well anights, from whom he had learned that I was dead, and how long it was ſince he was made believe that untruth: In fine, he wheedled him with all the gentle ways that melancholick perſons are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly won by. The <hi>Swede</hi> anſwered him, That he was infallibly aſſured that I was dead, and that I had given him notice of it by a Letter, which Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> interpreted to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100358:63"/>another effect of madneſs; but nothing could be more pleaſing than this that follows: Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> thinking he had found the Secret, to bring the young Count to his wits again, by proving to him that I was alive; and for that end having next day underſtood that I was come to Town, he entreated my Father to bring me to the Lodging of the poor <hi>Swede,</hi> to convince him of it, that ſo afterward they might bring him by degrees to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that all his other imaginations were as falſe, as his conceit that I was dead. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried me thither on that deſign; but I cannot forbear ſtill to laugh, when I think on the condition that I found him in. He was placed between a Phyſitian and an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whom in his own Jargon he abuſed and curſed bitterly, becauſe they would needs perſwade him that he was ill, and had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, that if he would not by fair means, they would force him to take a Clyſter. So ſoon as the poor man perceived me come in, his luck was bad, and theſe Gentlemen had great ſatisfaction; for being ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee me alive, he fainted away, which gave them fair opportunity to lay him upon the Bed, where praying my Father to lend them a hand, and drawing the Curtain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and me, that I might not behold a ſpectacle offenſive to a Lady, they adminiſtred
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100358:63"/>the Remedy propoſed, which made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtark mad when he was come to himſelf again. Ah! Fantaſme, cryed he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, caſting his eyes on me ſtill with terrour; De bad Imaage of a Woman, from I affe ſo mich looffed; and phy, phy, yw, ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to the Apothecary and Doctor; Sortſellers, (he would have ſaid Sorcerers) That de Tyvell affe mee to do wit yw? I cannot call to mind his proper terms; but in a word he Jargon'd in his own way a great many ſuch things, as if he would have accuſed the Phyſitians, and Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> that they had raiſed my Ghoſt to torment him, which obliged me to ſay to him; How then! Monſieur <hi>de Valdame,</hi> Do you love me no more? And for my ſake will you not at leaſt condeſcend to be cured? What reaſon have you to believe that I am dead? Give me your hand, and that you may be undeceived, take mine. To which the poor Gentleman, anſwering me only with his eyes, cryed out at length in <hi>Swediſh,</hi> which he addreſſed to Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> and who interpreted it to me: Ah! <hi>Gruſtaw;</hi> Am I then indeed a Fool, as they would make me believe? And if it be not ſo, can it be poſſible that they whom I love moſt, ſhould have endeavoured to put ſuch an affront on a perſon of my quality? That my Friend, that my Servants, and all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100358:64"/>ſhould conſpire in the ſame thing? With theſe words he turned his face to the Wall, that he might ſee no body any more; and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian thinking that he was going to ſleep, made a ſign with his hand that the Company ſhould withdraw. This we all did, except Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> who remembred the Clyſter, and ſtayed conſtantly by his Bed-ſide. Alas! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> I pity the poor Gentleman's condition. That was the way, added the Marqueſs, to make him become a Fool in reality. He fell into a great Fever, continued Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> and I know not as yet what the iſſue of it may prove. But that I may return to my Story: That unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate laughing-ſtock of Love and Fortune, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged his Clyſter, and finding no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with him but <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> addreſſed himſelf once more to him, all ſhaking and trembling at the thoughts of what was paſt. Tell me then, <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> ſaid he, ſpeak ſeriouſly; Am I a Fool, or am I not? Is it upon the account of ſome revenge that I am ſo uſed? Or am I in any Diſtemper that needs this uſage? I think not; but however explain to me in a word this myſtery. Apprehend not that you have to do with a Fool, whoſe humour muſt be ſoothed and complyed with: What Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſoever ye would make me believe I have, yet I think I ſpeak reaſon ſtill; tell me at leaſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100358:64"/>upon what ground is it that you build this my folly? <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> hearing him ſpeak in that manner, anſwered, That he would willingly ſhed the laſt drop of his blood to ſee him in good health; and that he might very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if he were ſo, they would not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains to uſe him as a ſick perſon. You know, Sir, ſaid he, that I am a poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe fortune depends ſolely on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Monſieur your Father, and that being ſo much obliged to you as I am; beſides that I ſhould be very loth to put a trick upon the Son of one of the greateſt Lords of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> I would not willingly do any thing that might in the leaſt diſpleaſe you. Forbear theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, replied the Count; and ſeeing you ought not to doubt but that I have (at leaſt at this time) ſome good intervals, becauſe I reaſon with you ſo ſoberly of my misfortune, ſatisfie me, I pray you. Well then, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> What would you have us think of your wit, when you would make men believe that Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> hath been in love with you? that you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand Love-Notes from her; that ſhe hath given you Meetings; that ſhe hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the higheſt Favours, ſhe who is a very modeſt and diſcreet Maid; that ſhe has asked of you Hangings, Furniture, and Cloaths; and by an exceſs of Fancy, you imagine her to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100358:65"/>be dead, when ſhe has not been ſo much as ſick; you go and comfort her Father, and at the end, you demand re-payment of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſums of Money. What would you have us, I ſay, think then, but that all theſe are viſions and fancies that have got into your brain? Perhaps it has come upon you at firſt by the contagion of the <hi>French</hi> Vanity; for the Love-Letters which in great number you have cauſed to be written to you, are no ſmall ſign of this; and coming afterward by degrees to be perſwaded of your own lyes, you are at length fallen hypocondriack. Let my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and age excuſe at your hands the freedom of this rebuke; I wiſh it might work a cure upon your mind, which perhaps is for ever out of order. Many other things beſides, they ſpake in <hi>Swediſh;</hi> the Count made his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> and <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> anſwered them. He told him that it was a thing abſolutely falſe, that he had ever ſeen me at any Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or that it muſt have been ſome other Woman that he took for me; that when I confeſſed that he had given me any Preſent, or that I had written to him, it was only with a deſign to divert my ſelf, and not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him, becauſe the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> had perſwaded me that he was a Fool. He told him ſo many other particulars, that the poor Patient diſcovered at length that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100358:65"/>Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> had always abuſed him. Ah! then, ſaid he, dear <hi>Gruſtaw,</hi> now I clearly ſee from whence both your miſtake and mine proceeds; the Raſcal whom you have juſt now named, hath villainouſly played upon me, and the condition that I am in, is a deplorable effect of my credulity and his knavery; it hath coſt me fifteen thouſand Crowns, and may perhaps ſtill coſt me my life. They diſcourſed afterward more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; and the unfortunate <hi>Swede</hi> calling to mind all the appearances <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> made no more doubt, but that the Chevalier <hi>de la Grancourt</hi> had converted to his own uſe all the Money and Preſents, which were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for me. But I aſſure you there was no body ſo much amazed as I, when Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> came and informed my Father of all, eſpecially when I came to know that my Chamber-maid was acceſſary to the Intrigue; for I could never have believed that ſhe would have betrayed me ſo ſhamefully. Intereſt can do any thing, ſaid the Marqueſs, with ſuch kind of perſons. What became of her? add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madam <hi>de Moulionne:</hi> Was ſhe ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to ſtay with you till theſe Intrigues were diſcovered? No, without doubt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> the Slut left me when I was ſtill in the Countrey, where ſhe had notice of the ſtorm that was preparing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100358:66"/>for her at <hi>Paris;</hi> for my Father had written to me of the laſt Fancy that the Stranger had had. Nevertheleſs we ſifted her a little, and by her means diſcovered many things, which perhaps may help for the recovery of the Hangings and Bed; but I am afraid it will not be a matter ſo eaſie to be done. From her alſo I got part of the Letters which I have ſhewed you, and which ſhe kept to make ſport with; for it was ſhe that received them for me; and Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> put the reſt into my hands, for fear that though they were counterfeited, yet they might be publiſhed to my diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In the mean time, continued ſhe, and I think I told you, the Stranger fell into a high Fever, for meer vexation that he had been ſo gull'd, and it is not yet known what the event of it may prove. Monſieur <hi>Gruſtaw</hi> and my Father theſe two days paſt have had many Conferences together, whereof I can give you no account, unleſs it be to take meaſures, how they may proceed againſt the Heirs of <hi>la Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> And this is the ſum of the Story which I had to tell you, which if I miſtake not, frees me ſufficiently from the Gallantries whereof I ſtand accuſed, and I think it will not a little contribute to the Embelliſhment of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance that we have begun. Now let any ſpeak who pleaſe.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100358:66"/>
               <p>The <hi>Chevalier de Montal</hi> would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as pretending not to have been fully perſwaded of the truth of that Hiſtory. But they were told that it was time to be gone, and that the Coach was ready. Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> preſſed all the Company to go take their places, and that was the reaſon that no body minding the Chevalier's diſcourſe; it behoved him to refer the telling of his thoughts untill they were upon the Road. Neither at that time found he any body for him, when he had ſpoken his mind; for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſuſpect the Modeſty and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Madamoiſelle Velzers;</hi> the Company thought it better to do her the injuſtice to think, that for all ſhe was ſo ſprightly, yet ſhe had not Wit enough to invent on the ſpot an Intrigue ſo well circumſtantiated.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs continued his Adorations to <hi>Clelia,</hi> and as he leaned to one ſide of the Coach, to whiſper her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the ear, the fair <hi>Hollander</hi> eſpied a paper in his pocket; which without being perceived by him, ſhe could eaſily pull out. <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> who ſaw it as ſoon as ſhe, gave her a ſign not to loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and told her ſoftly, That it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome ſweet Love-Letter, that might ſerve her to be revenged on him: But the Marqueſs purpoſely turning to know their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100358:67"/>deſign, prevented the blow, and crying that it was unjuſt to rob him on the one ſide, whil'ſt he was looſing his heart on the other, he put his hand quickly to his pocket. Monſieur the Marqueſs, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> ſhew us that Paper. What Paper, Madam? anſwered he. The Love-Letter, ſaid ſhe, of <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Seucelles,</hi> which we have ſeen ſticking out of your pocket. Ah! replied he, the Trick is dull; you would here wrong me in the eſteem of the fair Lady whom I love, by attacking me with another perſon whom I love not: but <hi>Madamoiſelle D'arviane</hi> hath too much Wit, not to diſcover the artifice. To all this the charming indiſpoſed Lady anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely with little ſmiles, which made her pretty Mouth admired; but at length that ſhe might entertain the Company in the gay hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that ſhe found her ſelf in; ſhe became, or pretended to be a little curious. Who is that <hi>Madamoiſelle Seucelles,</hi> then? ſaid ſhe to <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux.</hi> May nay not I know the commerce that paſſes betwixt her and the Marqueſs: And is her Beauty ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that I ought to fear he will forget me ſo ſoon as he ſees her again? It would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> if you had no more to be afraid of but the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Lady; for it is not with her that be is in love; and ſhe is but the Confident, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100358:67"/>to ſay better, the Agent of one of the Lovelieſt Ladies of the Kingdome. Ha! replied <hi>Clelia,</hi> let the Company do me right then. I have told the Story that I know of the Marqueſs; therefore I intreat ſome body to tell me that. Alas, ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> you may be told it in a few words.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOnſieur</hi> the Marqueſs is in love with the Counteſs of <hi>Tourueüil,</hi> ſo that you may already judge if he hath not planted his Amours in a rich Field. Every one knows that that young Lady hath been ſacrificed by her Father to a Husband whom ſhe could never love; for the Count of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueüil</hi> is one of your pretended Bigots, and a clowniſh man; and there is nothing more gentile, and leſs devote than his Lady; Sympathie does not commonly ſpring from ſuch oppoſite Qualities. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> who ſeems cut out for making his advantage of all good occaſions, payed a Viſite one day to the Counteſs, juſt when the old jealous pate and ſhe had been
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100358:68"/>gravelling, and the ground of their quarrel was, becauſe by a capricious whimſey worthy ſuch a one as himſelf, he had cauſed a picture that hung behind her bed to be dawbed over; by reaſon, ſaid he, that it was a naked piece which was not fit a young Lady ſhould look upon, and which might bring idle thoughts into her mind.</p>
               <p>Well! ſaid the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> interrupting, and he had reaſon; for it was a cunning piece of Policy by that means to remove from Madam the Counteſs all pretext of tentations. Who knows, but that ſhe might have come a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he was about his ſpiritual exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Hold your peace, you caviller, replied Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> no body asks you the queſtion whether he had reaſon or not in doing what he did. The Counteſs <hi>de Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neüil</hi> who felt no tentations by beholding Pictures, or who thinking leſs harm than theſe Zealous Pater-noſter-men, did not ſeek occaſions from inanimate things; was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled at the grievous effect of her Husband's impertinent ſcrupuloſity. And her diſcontent grew ſo high, when ſhe had called to mind a thouſand other diſpleaſures that ſhe had received from ſo ridiculous a man; that ſhe would live no longer with him. She told the Marqueſs, That ſhe had a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeparate from him, in which he had a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100358:69"/>ſpecial care to confirm her, untill the day that was pitched upon for putting the deſign in execution; And the day being come, the Lady about Mid-night in a Gentleman's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel ſlipt out of her own houſe; came to one of the Marqueſs's, about three leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſtayed there all the reſt of the Night. There paſſed nothing but what was honeſt and civil, ſayes the Story, and nothing but what any fair Lady, being in the place of the Counteſs of <hi>Tourneüil,</hi> might have done without danger, in acknowledgment to the Services of the Marqueſs; for he excuſed her upon promiſe that ſhe would ſhew him all kind of favours, when ſhe could once return to <hi>France,</hi> and be there Miſtreſs at home, wherewith the Marqueſs was ſatisfied .... Ah! cried the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> you are ſweetly paid off, Marqueſs, you are rightly ſerved, and there is your recompence for the unſeaſonable diſcretion you uſed with that Lady; if it be true though, that you uſed any: for I take you not to be ſo ignorant of the way that Women would be uſed. If what is ſuppoſed of me be true, anſwered the Marqueſs, perhaps I carried my ſelf with no leſs reſpect towards that Lady. We know very well, replied Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> that you put on a garb of Civility when you have a mind, and it concerns you to do ſo here. But in fine,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100358:69"/>continued ſhe, I have ſuppoſed nothing in that Story. The Marqueſs ſwore inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Counteſs, that he might oblige her to remember her promiſe one day. They laid down their meaſures that they ſhould corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond by Letters, when the Lady was got into <hi>England,</hi> where ſhe pretended a deſign to go ſee her Friends. <hi>Madamoiſelle de Seucelles,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken; and who hath a Houſe in <hi>Herminvilliers,</hi> or to ſay better, near it; for <hi>Herminvilliers</hi> is but one Houſe; that Lady, I ſay, who is overjoyed when ſhe can perform ſome certain good offices, was pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to receive and deliver the Letters. It was alſo reſolved, That the Marqueſs ſhould interpret to himſelf all that ſeemed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten onely to that good Lady, and that there ſhould be a little mark on the margin of the Letters, to give notice every time that he was to explain them in that manner; and that was a Caution againſt the Curious, if they happened to be intercepted. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe went away in the habit of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, came to <hi>Calais,</hi> embarked in the firſt Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and at length arrived at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> from whence ſhe writes daily with much tenderneſs to the Marqueſs. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that is the reaſon which made me ſuſpect that he was going ſecretly this Night towards <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minvilliers,</hi> becauſe we have been told that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100358:70"/>he goes thither frequently in that manner.</p>
               <p>Judge you, <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> added ſhe, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſelf to <hi>Clelia,</hi> what is to be thought of a man who hath ſo fair hopes, and ſo near at hand, (for the Lady is ſaid to be upon her return) and who nevertheleſs playes the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Lover with you. What? ſaid the lovely <hi>Clelia,</hi> is the Counteſs coming back again? Madam, anſwered the Marqueſs, you have been told a tale as to what concerns me in the Hiſtory of the Counteſs; but though all that is told you were true; yet you may ſecurely liſten to me, if nothing hinder you but her return. Ha! replied <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> I have been aſſured that ſhe was come to <hi>Calais,</hi> and that her Husband by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation had conſented to be no more Maſter at home. <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> replied ſhe, I know the whole Hiſtory better than you. Truly, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> we make no doubt of it, conſidering what <hi>Madamoiſelle de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſieux</hi> hath told us. That is nothing, replied he pleaſantly, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> is Jealous, becauſe I have given my heart to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle D'Arviane;</hi> and one ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what a Jealous Lady may ſay. But in fine, his is the Story which I bragg that I know better than ſhe, and it very well deſerves to come in with the reſt.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF The Count of <hi>Tourueüil.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ABout two Months ago, the Count of <hi>Tourueüil</hi> went to pay a Viſite to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, ſome fifteen or ſixteen Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi> There was but one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church for three or four Gentlemen who live in the Neighbourhood of the Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that perſon. One day, as the Count was there at Maſs, he ſaw a young Maid, whoſe Father was Steward of a little eſtate that lay thereabouts. She was not above fifteen years old, and had Eyes not to be beheld without danger; ſhe pleaſed the Count ſo much as that ſhe was like to have marred all his devotion. He came out of the Church in great diſorder, &amp; as it was his cuſtom to reſiſt a little before he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100358:71"/>gave way to tentation; ſo he ſtudied how he might avoid a ſecond ſight of that Girle, he ſent her word by the Curat of the Pariſh, that he entreated her to come no more to Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure for <hi>Paris.</hi> This firſt means taking no effect; (for the Father and Mother of the Maid were honeſt folks that feared God, and who would by no means have her loſe Maſs;) he cauſed it he propoſed to them, that if they would put her into a Cloiſter that ſhe might become a Nun, he would pay what Money might be demanded with her. But they made anſwer that they had a portion to give with their daughter in marriage; that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſee her provided of a Husband, yea and that their Maſter was about to marrie her. So that the poore Count of <hi>Tourneüil,</hi> reduced to deſpair reſolved to flie for it, and returned with all expedition to <hi>Paris;</hi> but he felt the wound ſtill in his heart. That all powerfull Idea left him no where in repoſe. It was to much purpoſe for him indeed to faſt and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the fleſh; the pulſe of a quaking Bigot beats quicker than that of another, the ſtripes of diſcipline did but more and more warme him. What muſt the poore man do in this caſe? they asked him if there was no way left of accommodation with his wife, that ſeemed to him to be a meſſage from God, nothing appeared more proper for his cure than ſhe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100358:71"/>and being perſecuted by that pityleſs friend that continually tormented him, he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends that ſhe ſhould return upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ſhe pleaſed, provided ſhe did it ſpeedily. News of this being ſent to London, ſhe repaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſea and came to <hi>Calais,</hi> where the Count had promiſed to go and receive her; but by ill luck the temptation had leiſure to abate, whil'ſt the meſſengers went between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> ſo that when the Lady came to <hi>Calais,</hi> ſhe found no body there to receive her in name of the Count. She was complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely by a man with a long beard and hood, who told her that there was no way to be ſaved but by ſubmitting to her Husband; and ſeeing that was not the thing that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her moſt, ſhe re-imbarked next day with greater hatred than before againſt the Count of <hi>Tourneüille.</hi> And this is the reaſon Ladies that ſhe returns not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as he had ended theſe words the Coach ſtopt. They found that they were come to the houſe of Monſieur <hi>Provoſt,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de Moulionne</hi> was arrived two long hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with his uſuall Companion, that is to ſay his little Sollicitor.

               <p>THE Baron of <hi>Coulan,</hi> who is a handſom well-ſpoken Gentleman, and much of the ſame ſhape and ſtature, ſaid the good old man, looking on the Marqueſs of <hi>Riber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> with Monſieur the Marqueſs there; I mean, (qualifying a little what he had ſaid) a man of an excellent Meen. Spare me, Sir, if you pleaſe, ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting him, I am your moſt humble Servant; I am yours, Sir, replied the good man, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his Diſcourſe; that Gentleman, ſaid he, having then familiarity in the Houſe of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100358:74"/>the Guardian of a young Lady, called Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de la Templiere,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Poictow,</hi> got into acquaintance, and became paſſionately in love with her. She was pretty, ſang and danced well, had much wit; and what was the moſt real, perhaps, of all her good qualities, ſhe was to have twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Livers a year.</p>
               <p>That was a Beauty, without doubt, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting him. So it was, ſaid he; but taking ill that ſhe ſhould have ſpoken, Wife, ſaid he, I would have you be quiet, and not interrupt me; this made all the Company for ſome time break the thread of the Diſcourſe. Sir, anſwered they, Fear not that there ſhall be a word loſt of all you ſay, for we hear you with all imaginable intention. Well then, replied he, if that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe not the Company, I muſt acknowledg my weakneſs, it troubles me tho. That an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer having made a kind of Law againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers, the Guardian of that young Lady, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, deſerves not ſo many praiſes from me, as I have given to the Lover and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. He was a covetous man, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent capable of all ſorts of baſeneſs, for there is nothing that avarice prompts not men to do. He delayed as much as he could to give her in Marriage, becauſe he found the enjoyment of her Eſtate very ſweet, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100358:74"/>he feared nothing more than to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an account; but all his delays were of little uſe to him, ſeeing the parties had a great mind to one another, and murually loved; it behoved him to comply with the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the young Lady, who was witty, and would have wrought him a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in caſe he refuſed. However, making the beſt uſe he could of the violent paſſion, which he knew the Baron of <hi>Coulan</hi> had for her, he cauſed this Propoſition to be made to the Gentleman; That he would conſent to the Marriage, provided he would give him a Warren, which he had long covered, becauſe it lay convenient for him; otherways, that he ſhould deſiſt from his Suit. The Baron of <hi>Coulan,</hi> who would have given his life for the enjoyment of his Miſtreſs, made no difficulty at firſt to condeſcend to it; but the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marriage, when the other preſſed him to ſeal a Deed of Conveyance for that Warren, with a full diſcharge of the Purchaſe Money, he had a great mind to have his Wife, and to keep the Warren ſtill, imagining therefore that matters were gone too far for the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Guardian to dare to break them off, and that he might be afraid leſt after the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, his covetous Propoſition ſhould come to light: He hoped, perhaps, at length eaſily to diſappoint him; but that was the reaſon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100358:75"/>that the Guardian of Madamoiſelle broke the Marriage clear off, and forbad the Lover his Houſe. He likewiſe enjoyned his Pupil not to receive him any more, upon pain of being ſhut up in a Cloiſter; but to diſcharge young Lovers from ſeeing one another, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to do it. And thus our Couple contrived the matter; for the gentile young Lady was reſolved to proceed further; and one day when her Uncle dreamt of no ſuch thing, ſhe conſenting to be convey'd away by her Lover, went and married him in a Village, where there was an Abbey of Nuns; and as ſhe came out of the Church, entered into the Monaſtery, from whence ſhe immediately preferred a Petition, that ſhe might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go live with her Husband, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the caveat and oppoſitions of her Uncle.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, not to interrupt you, ſaid <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> dryly, and riſing from his Seat; Went ſhe into the Convent before ſhe lay with the Baron of <hi>Coulan?</hi> A fine queſtion indeed! cryed Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> pulling him rudely back to his Seat; he muſt needs come out with that impertinency. Sir, ſaid ſhe to the Judge, Mind him not in the leaſt; for the Chevalier <hi>de Montal</hi> is one of the greateſt Fools in <hi>France.</hi> Hold, Madam, ſaid the good man, mildly, What the Gentleman has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100358:75"/>is not the moſt unreaſonable queſtion in the World; and it had been far better that Madamoiſelle <hi>de la Templiere</hi> had done what ſhe did, before ſhe entered into the Convent, than ſince. Ah! replied Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> That's another matter, and I know not what ſhe hath done. It is alledged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, That as her Guardian proſecuted the Baron of <hi>Coulan</hi> for the Rape, and that he pretended as a proof of the violence, that that Gentleman was obliged to put the Lady into the Monaſtery, by reaſon that ſhe would never conſent to the conſummation of the Marriage; the gentle Dove was got with Child by him through the Grates of the Parlour, to ſhew that it was not for lack of good will, that ſhe had not perfected the Marriage before. At theſe words there was none, no not ſo much as the fair <hi>Clelia,</hi> that could forbear to ſhew a little ſurprize, at firſt by a ſmile which they checkt by biting their lips, but which at length broke forth into an exceſſive Fit of laughter. In the mean while Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, Is not this a fair Tale, ſaid ſhe, that Monſieur the Judge has told us? Heark ye, Madam, anſwered he, I tell you nothing but what has been pleaded, and I refer my ſelf to the Minutes of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Nuns, who were concerned for the pollution of the Convent, pretended to have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100358:76"/>been committed by the Baron of <hi>Coulan,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he begot that Child in the Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Cell, Madamoiſelle <hi>de Meſſina</hi> another Penſioner being preſent, who fearing leſt the Gallant might be miſtaken, becauſe ſhe lay with Madamoiſelle <hi>de la Templiere,</hi> ſewed up the bottom of her Smock every night; that to accompliſh his deſign, he had got over the Wall of the little Garden, into which lookt the Chamber-window of the Lady <hi>de la Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliere,</hi> and that being there, he had made uſe of a Ladder wherewith they pruned the Trees, and by that Window entered into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That is far more probable, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne:</hi> And why ſo, Madam? anſwered <hi>Montal;</hi> For my part, I think, that there is a great deal more appearance that the feat was done in the Parlour, than elſewhere; for there was need of no ſuch great myſtery to get in; and though the young Lady boyled not much at the prophanation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, yet without doubt, ſhe liked that place better which is not conſecrated ground, than another.</p>
               <p>The four Ladies during this Diſcourſe, asked one another a hundred confuſed queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make it thought that they minded it not; but <hi>Montal</hi> having drawn from Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> a kind of a Box on the ear, for ſome foppery that he had whiſpered to her on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100358:76"/>the ſame Subject, they began again to laugh in conſort, and ſo earneſtly, that they made it well appear, they had not loſt one word of all that he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montal</hi> in the mean time withdrew ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly with his Box, that the good man and the Marqueſs could not for bear to laugh alſo; the Judge however rebuked his Wife for it; but ſhe told him, I pray you, Mr. Judge, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with your Story, and take no cognizance of this: She ſaid; that nevertheleſs, looking every minute behind her, to ſee the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Chevalier, who ſo ſoon as the thought of his affront was a little over, came to ſit down by Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> but ſhe would not admit of him, and the like did all the reſt, by whom he offered to ſit down, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he fell a railing againſt all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and was forced to ſtand on his legs.</p>
               <p>Amidſt this Converſation, Monſieur the Judge was told, That there was a Lackey come from Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> to know if he was arrived, and to acquaint him, that his Maſter, who had two or three words to ſay to him, was not far off. This obliged the good old man to leave the Company, that he might receive that Gentleman; yet before he roſe, Madam his Lady asked him, if he would not compleat his Story, and if it ended at ſo fine a period; who anſwering, That that was all,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100358:77"/>and the matter they had decided; he told them, That the Court had annulled that fair Marriage, diſcharged the Baron of <hi>Coulan,</hi> to beget any more Children on the Lady <hi>de la Templiere</hi> through the Grate, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned both him and the Guardian in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain penalty; the one for the Rape, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Grate, and the other for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded the Warren, with permiſſion nevertheleſs to the ſaid <hi>Coulan</hi> and <hi>la Templie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> to be married once again, provided it were performed with all the requiſite Formalities. And thus ended the Relation of the Judge, who at theſe words left all the Company in the Garden until next meeting.</p>
               <p>When he was gone, the Marqueſs began to ſpeak: If, ſaid he, I were as confident as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> I would tell you a pleaſant Story of that ſame Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> who, if I miſtake not, is a great fat <hi>Norman,</hi> and whoſe Lady is as innocent as he is cunning and witty. Is he of <hi>Normandy?</hi> replied <hi>Montal.</hi> Ah! If it be Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> I know him as well as you, and his Lady alſo; and I'll tell you the Story, if the Company pleaſe. Tell it then, replied the Marqueſs, I yield you the honour; and we, interrupted Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> if there be any fopperies in it, we will not hear it. Ladies, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> I aſſure you the ſting is only
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100358:77"/>in the tail, and you may hear the beginning without any fear; I ſhall give you notice when I come to the tickling point, and ſhall ſtop there, if you pleaſe. Let it be ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> but I give you notice, that in caſe you chance to trip, my hand is heavier than Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi>'s. Well, well, ſaid he, you ſhall do all that you pleaſe; only give me the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> and his Lady.</head>
               <p>THat I may diſpoſe you to believe the Adventure of that groſs Man, I muſt tell you what his Lady was before he married her. She was Widow to a Perſon of Quality, who was very rich, moſt peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, exceedingly jealous, and deadly old; three qualities that made him look out for a Wife who wanted wit to take notice of them, and who was ſimple enough to believe that all rich men were caſt in the ſame mould. He met with that happy diſpoſition in this Lady, who was born in <hi>Picardy;</hi> I name her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to you, that I may not do too great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Normandy,</hi> by attributing to it ſuch
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100358:78"/>rare productions. She was of a good Family, and was very proud of that; but her Portion was but ſmall. It is not my deſign to tell you all that happened during their Marriage, I know but too little of that; you ſhall only judge of the Piece by the Pattern. Ye have heard ſay, that heretofore the Queen having askt a great Lord of the Court, when his Lady would be brought to Bed, he anſwered, When your Majeſty pleaſes, Madam; the miſtake perhaps was that that good Lord had taken one word for another; but when Madam <hi>de Lucheres</hi> made a like anſwer to the like queſtion, it was out of a deſign, made up of civility and ſubmiſſion to the pleaſure of a great Princeſs; and her ſimplicity went ſo far, that that Princeſs having ſince ſaid by way of wiſh, Heavens! Madam, How great a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would you do me, to be brought to Bed in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that you might go with me to <hi>Gourbon?</hi> She returned home in all haſte and told her Husband, that he ſhould ſend for the Midwife; that ſhe would by no means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige ſo good a Princeſs, and that ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infallibly to be brought to Bed next night. This, Ladies, is the true Character of the Wit of Madam <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> and what to my knowledge happened in her Husbands Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Now I'll tell you a pleaſant paſſage that occurred on the day of her ſecond Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100358:79"/>
               <p>How faſt do ye run, Chevalier? ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting him; and know you nothing elſe until the time of her ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? No, anſwered <hi>Montal.</hi> I'll tell you then ſomewhat, ſaid the Marqueſs, for you forgot the beſt paſſage of all.</p>
               <p>She was about ſix months a Widow, and as ſhe was beloved of all men, as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her ſingular beauty, as of that candor and ingenuity wherein ſhe excelled all others of her Sex, ſo, few paſſed that way near her Houſe, without ſtepping aſide a little to viſit her. Monſieur, the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> in his Progreſs through that Countrey, came one morning very early to her Houſe, and was at her Chamber-door before ſhe had time to be advertiſed of it; ſhe was ſtill abed when the Prince entered her Chamber. Alas! my Lord, cried ſhe, In what confuſion does your Highneſs here put me? Juſt God! my Lord, Have you ſo little kindneſs for me, as to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me in this manner, and to neceſſitate me to fail in my duty? (all her trouble was that ſhe could not courtſie abed) be pleaſed then, ſaid ſhe, my Lord, to ſtay a moment, and come no nearer. Afterward ſhe roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in her Smock, went and took her night-Gown, advanced and made him five or ſix reverend Courtſies; and then glad that ſhe had done her duty, returned back, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100358:79"/>went to Bed in the ſame manner ſhe had riſen. The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> ſate down by her Beds-ſide; and among many things that ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for diſcourſe, they fell at length to ſpeak of the Lady's Village: I think, Madam, ſaid he, that this Lordſhip of yours has many Priviledges. Yes, my Lord, anſwered ſhe, it hath the right of Bake-houſe and Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; and beſides that, I can make all my Tenants keep Pigs for me. Ah! Monſieur the Marqueſs, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſteux,</hi> You add ſome ornaments to the Story; for is it poſſible that a Lady could be ſo ſimple? Upon my Honour, Madamoiſelle, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> he ſays true; never was there ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city like to that of Madam <hi>de Lucheres.</hi> Can you tell no more then, continued he, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the Marqueſs. No, anſwered the Marqueſs; and you may now relate the other Fopperies, if theſe Ladies will hear you. Oh! no, let him have a care of that, cried they. Good now! Ladies, replied he, Truſt to my word; it is too ſoon yet to take the alarm, and I have promiſed to give you warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it is time. Well then, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> Let him go on; and if he dare tell any Waggery, let him venture. Z'ouks! anſwered he, I am in continual fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt among you, and I had as good be amongſt my Enemies. Go on, go on, ſaid the Marqueſs,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100358:80"/>hey will not be ſo ſevere to you as they ſay. Ah! Curſed Gravity, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> It is you that undoes me in their eſteem, and by the oppoſition of a counterfeit modeſty and civility, with which you would diſguiſe your ſelf, notwithſtanding all that is publickly known of your life, ſpoils every thing that I ſpeak here. This Repartie made the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny laugh; but Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> ſaid, Good now, Let him make an end of his Story, that he may win a Box or two. Yes, yes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> That is the way we ſhould ſpeak, if we have mind to hear Waggery; you ſeem to be as good as he. Leave off theſe Debates, anſwered the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, and if I am to be beaten, let it be ſo; But I will go on with my Relation.</p>
               <p>Two or three days before the Lady married Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> a Gentleman, near of Kin to her Husband, deſiring to give ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Raillery on the Wedding-day, told the Bride, That ſhe was happy in marrying Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> whoſe merit, good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a thouſand other rare qualities, made him eſteemed by all men. And that which at preſent I think moſt advantageous in him, Madam, ſaid he, is, That you may be aſſured, he will uſe you much better than your former Husband did. Ha! Sir, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the witty Lady, My firſt Husband uſed me
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100358:80"/>well, and I were to be blamed, if I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him. Alas good man, he hath left me twenty thouſand Livers a year; what would you have him do more, than give me all his Eſtate? The Eſtate is fair, replied the Gentleman; but that is not enough for ſuch a Lady of Quality as you are, if ſhe be not treated with all the reſpect that is due to her, and that your firſt Husband never did. Ah! Sir, Excuſe me, ſaid ſhe. Good Heavens! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, He hath bragg'd of it himſelf to me that ſpeak to you. He uſed you as common people uſe their Wives, and as a Farmer would uſe his, but not like a perſon of your Birth and Quality. And how was that then? anſwered ſhe, all amazed. Good, good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Gentleman, making a laughter, as if you did not know it; but you carry your ſelf like a modeſt Lady, in concealing the faults of your dead Husband. I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid ſhe, if you expreſs your ſelf no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, I know not what you would ſay to me.</p>
               <p>And I aſſure you, ſaid the Marqueſs, if you make not an end very quickly, you ſhall not be well beaten; for I ſee the Judge bringing his man along with him, and there they are already at the end of the Garden.</p>
               <p>I conclude, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> and he expected that at theſe words the Ladies would have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100358:81"/>been gone for fear of hearing the end of the Story: but none of them budged from their places, which began to put him in ſome fear. I appeal to you Ladies, ſaid he, if there has been the leaſt ſcandalous word in all that I have told you. No, anſwered <hi>Madamoiſelle de Barbiſicux,</hi> and hitherto we have nothing to ſay to you. Well! replied he, fair Ladies take the pains then, if ye pleaſe, to be gone whither ye will, for the reſt will not be of the ſame ſtrain, and there is none but Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> that can modeſtly hear it. How, I, anſwered ſhe, I will not hear it no more than they, and I will be gone with the reſt. We pretend not to be gone, ſaid <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> we have a deſign to drub him ſoundly, if he be not diſcreet. They ſtir not, replied <hi>Montal;</hi> and I'le die if they be not more curious to hear than I am to tell it; but to puniſh them, added he, ſpeaking to the Marqueſs, I'le whiſper it you in the Ear, and they ſhall not hear a word.</p>
               <p>With that, drawing near in effect to the Marqueſs's Ear, he told him; You muſt know then, that upon the debate that was betwixt the Gentleman and Lady, who could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe how her Husband had uſed her ill; the Gentleman told her, Is it not true, Madam, that when he would pay you his amorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, he—he ſaid it roguiſhly, and I ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100358:81"/>it purpoſely, leſt theſe Ladies, who would not hear me ſpeak aloud, ſhould liſten to what I tell you ſoftly, and take thereby occaſion to quarrel with me. The Marqueſs could not forbear to burſt forth in laughter at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Chevalier had told him that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece of waggery; and, ſaid <hi>Madam de Moulionne,</hi> my life for it, he has been telling him ſome egregious foppery. I knew the Story very well, anſwered the <hi>Marqueſs;</hi> but I confeſs I ſhould have much ado to have put it in ſo clean linnen. Do not tell them that, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> they I be ſtark mad that they have not heard it. And yet for all that I am apt to believe, ſaid he, that they have not ſo much as loſt one ſingle word of all I ſaid; but however it be, that was the conceit that the Gentleman told <hi>Madam de Lucheres,</hi> and ſhe anſwered him; Should not my Husband then have uſed me ſo? Good God! <hi>Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, make you any doubt of that? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality take a far more civil courſe with their Ladies; but your Husband either underſtood not what Civility was, or, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did enough to leave you his Eſtate, made no account to uſe you better. Alas! Sir, replied ſhe, I believed that all Women ſhould have been uſed at that rate, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured it contentedly and without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but what would you have? I was an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100358:82"/>Innocent young thing on whom he impoſed; for had I known that he ſhould have gone another way to work; I ſtand ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my quality, as not to have ſuffered any thing that might have wronged it.</p>
               <p>The marrow of the Jeſt was, that ſome dayes after, the Lady was married to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Lucheres;</hi> and when the Bridgroom was put to Bed, and would have carreſſed his Bride, ſhe would by no means ſuffer him in the manner he deſired; ſhe ſtrugled againſt him with all her might and main, ſaying that ſhe would be ſooner cut into pieces, than be made conſent to it, and that women of her quality were to be uſed otherways; that if her late Husband had taken advantage of her tender years, ſhe ſhould have care that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould not do the like for the future. In fine, the pleaſant diſpute laſted ſo long, that the Gentlemen who heard all at the Door with ſome of the gueſts, was foreed to come and undeceive her by Laughing and Drolling on the Bridegroom. I am far miſtaken, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if any of You ever expoſe your Husbands to ſuch raileries.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Montal</hi> made an end, and the Ladies had not much time to repartie, becauſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Lucheres</hi> came to joyn the company. He ſaluted the Ladies and Marqueſs, hugg'd and embraced the Chevalier becauſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100358:82"/>acquaintance, and after ſome brisk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments on all hands; Monſieur the Judge told them that it was time to go to ſupper. All the company went up into the Hall, and ſat down at Table. It was no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared with Gallantry, like the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> had given them; but the Supper was nothing worſe, and they who know the ſumptuous humour of Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> will make no doubt but that having foreſeen that ſhe was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſo goodly a company, ſhe would not fail to do things handſomely. It was a ſign the treat was good becauſe they fed heartily; and ſo ſoon as their hunger was a little aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they began to talk, and drink Healths. The Marqueſs began with a Health to Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> which he addreſſed to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Montal.</hi> So, anſwered the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, it is becauſe ſhe gave me a box on the Ear that you would have me drink her Health. Away, ſaid ſhe, Monſieur <hi>le Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> drink it, I ſhall give no more blows. But Madam, replied the Marqueſs, may not we know what it was he told you? <hi>par ma foy,</hi> replied <hi>Montal,</hi> I'll ſay it once more. Hold there, interrupted Madamoiſelle <hi>de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſieux,</hi> you ſit pretty near me, and you know what I have told you of my heavy hand. Z'owks, anſwered he ſhrugging up his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100358:83"/>and looking pitifully on Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres;</hi> where am I got now? poor friend, ſaid he, you believe that you have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company of Angels, and they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. I have found no ſuch thing as yet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that Gentleman, and if all the Devils were like them, men would give themſelves to the Devil more freely than they do. Well, well, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> you'll know in time what ſtuff they are made of, however I will pledge the Health that the Marqueſs has drank to me. I think you, Monſ. the Chevalier, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> After that they drank a Health to the Judge, who did the like to Madam <hi>D'arvianne;</hi> and that fair Lady being entreated to ſing by the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> who never took his Eyes off of her, ſhe delighted the company with a ſhort merry Air, which put the old Judge in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good humour. Then did Jeſts ſlie about, joy and mirth reigned without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, and a thouſand little tricks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for ſport and laughter; amongſt which was not the leaſt the cheat that the Foot-boyes put upon the good little man the Solicitor, whom the Judge had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him; for theſe Rogues knowing that he mortally hated water, ſerved him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in a double Glaſs, at the foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they poured in Wine to an equal height
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100358:83"/>with the Water; and the poor Dandy-prat was obſerved to make faces every time he pledged a Health, not daring to tell the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor why he drank not all up, having only touched the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>At length, after that the fruit was ſet on the Table, Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> leaning to the Ear of the Marqueſs; Sir, ſaid ſhe, if we would hear another pleaſant ſtory, we muſt oblige that little man, to tell us what lately befell him. I believe Madam, anſwered Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres</hi> who had heard that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it will be no hard matter to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and if ſo be you tell him that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. No, ſaid ſhe, my Husband perhaps will take it ill if it come from me; ſome body elſe muſt ſtart the matter, and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> will be the fitteſt Perſon in the World for that. For what will I be fit for? replied that Lady who heard her ſelf named. Monſieur the Marqueſs will tell you, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> and the Marqueſs told her in effect what the buſineſs was.</p>
               <p>Immediately ſhe called for Wine, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Company to do the like. Then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf to Monſieur the Judge, ſhe told him, that ſhe was going to drink a round to his good health; but that ſeeing ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſome balked their Glaſſes, he that left a drop of Wine in his Glaſs, ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100358:84"/>relate the moſt pleaſant Adventure of his Life, and that without exception of any, no not of Monſieur the Solicitor. The good little Man perceiving very well what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux,</hi> laughing, That the Plot was not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly laid againſt him, but that he heard ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well what Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> had ſaid to the Marqueſs; but that he had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to leave nothing in the bottom of his Glaſs. In that caſe, Mr. Solicitor, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, you ſhall not be obliged to any thing. With that he thought to avoid the blow, by gulping down all that was in his Glaſs; but he was never ſo ſurprized, as when he ſaw all the Wine remain, and that he began at length to diſcover the Cheat. Ah! Poor Mr. <hi>Tigean,</hi> cried the Judge, You are tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd. My faith! That's true, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, and I have not as yet drank one drop of Wine. In the mean time the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laughed till they held their ſides again, and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> in purſuance of her deſign, ſaid, Come, come, Mr. Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, you would willingly find an evaſion; but you have incurred the penalty, ſeeing your Glaſs is not empty; and you muſt tell us the Story of your Priory. Ah! anſwered the little Man, I appeal to Monſieur the Judge; that is not juſt. Poor Friend, replied the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100358:84"/>Judge, I have not the greateſt Authority here, and you are concluded. They have obliged me my ſelf upon my coming to tell them a Story; and if they be reſolved that you relate yours, there is no remedy for it; I adviſe you to drink three or four good Glaſſes of Wine, and do as they bid you. That is very hard though, Sir, ſaid he; but to be ſhort, Ladies Wills muſt be obeyed; if they laugh at me, at leaſt they are not the firſt that have done ſo.</p>
               <p>With theſe words he called for a Glaſs, and a Bottle of the beſt Wine, of which according to the directions of the Judge, he drank a Health to his Auditory; and that Liquor hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put a little more life in him, than the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had drank, he began the Hiſtory they deſired in this manner.</p>

               <p>IT is not I alone who have contributed to the Occurrences of this Story, and there are others beſides my ſelf, that have a large ſhare in it; but it is I who have been toſſed moſt. About ſix months ago, a Gentleman, or who called himſelf one, a modeſt man in his behaviour, and whom no body would ever have taken for a Cheat; but I aſſure you, we muſt not judge of people by their looks: That Gentleman then who ſaid he was of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> courted for Marriage a Maid of my acquaintance. She was a Gentlewoman, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100358:85"/>had long waited on Madam the Dutcheſs of ..... I cannot hit of her Name; but ſo much I know, ſhe gathered above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns in her ſervice; and beſides that money, ſhe had a great many other good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; for ſhe was of a tractable and gentle diſpoſition, ſcolded to the life, and rejected not the Merchants. In a word, ſhe was a Girl whom the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin,</hi> he that makes ſuch pretty little Songs, ſaw and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often; yet no body miſtruſted any harm, and they were both looked upon to be very civil perſons. He that ſought her in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, was called Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne;</hi> and you muſt obſerve, that it was a Name he had taken to himſelf, the ſame with that of a Gentleman of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> who poſſeſſed a very handſom Eſtate. This he did, that he might more eaſily beguile the Maid, if ſhe ſhould have informed her ſelf of the Eſtate, which he pretended to have in that Province.</p>
               <p>Matters proceeding very well, to the great ſatisfaction of the Laſs, and the Articles of Marriage being ſigned, there was nothing wanting but a Bill of Exchange for four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers, which the future Husband ſaid was upon the Road, and which was ſent him from the Countrey, to buy Neceſſaries againſt the Wedding; but that Bill being too ſlow in coming, for it was only in his fancy, our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100358:86"/>Gentleman at length who had his deſign in all this, bethought himſelf to counterfeit a Letter, wherein the reaſons of the delay were ſpecified, whereat he ſeemed to be deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted. At the ſame time he ſet himſelf to prepare another, which he wrote himſelf as well as the former, and in this he had news of the death of a certain Prior in <hi>Languedock,</hi> whoſe Benefice being worth three thouſand Livers a year, was at his diſpoſal. The news being come to the Gentleman, you may judg how much joy he expreſſed; it could not have appeared more real, if it had been true; God gave him by that means a way to regain the money, whereof he was diſappointed by the Bill of Exchange; and that ſerved not a little alſo, to make the Maid judge her ſelf more happy, conſidering the fair Patronage that was annexed to her Husband's Eſtate.</p>
               <p>She could not let one day paſs over, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting her Friends with it, and the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin</hi> firſt of all. This Man having heard of three thouſand Livers a year, thought that with that he might have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity enough to make Songs at leiſure; and nibling at the Bait, Good God! ſaid he, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle, Seeing you have an abſolute power over that Gentleman, may not you ſo carry matters, as to make him nominate me to that Benefice? He will rather chuſe to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100358:86"/>oblige ſuch a man as I who have ſome reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who ſhall beſides beſtow on him a conſiderable Preſent, than to favour perhaps ſome unknown perſon, upon the bare recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ſome great Lord, who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thank him for it. Heark ye, Propoſe the matter to him, and let me be obliged to you, for having added three thouſand Livers a year to my ſmall Living; it will be a way to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh my Muſe. Dad! Let it be ſo, and we ſhall feed on Capons. The Damſel promiſed to ſpeak about it, and in effect ſpake the ſame Evening to her Sweet-heart concerning the matter. This Blade thought that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fleeced the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin,</hi> of three or four hundred pieces. He made anſwer to Madamoiſelle <hi>Beffemont,</hi> for that was the Maid's Name, that ſhe was abſolute Miſtreſs of all that belonged to him, and ſhe might paſs her word to the Abbot, that the Benefice ſhould be his, and that ſhe ſhould likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the acknowledgement which he ſhould make.</p>
               <p>The Miſtreſs full of joy, next morning told the Abbot the good News, who went to thank the Gentleman, and offer him the greateſt friendſhip in the World. There paſſed not one day after, but that he ſent him Copies of Verſes; I know not how they call them, Songs or Sonnets I think, wherein in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100358:87"/>of his Preſentation, he deſcribed the pleaſures that the Rent of the Priory would procure them, which ſhould be ſtill as much at the diſpoſal of the Gentleman as of himſelf; and in fine, he ſent him a great many other fine things, to which the cunning Knave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered only in the ſame kind by Verſes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no haſte to give him his Preſentation; for he would in no ways truſt to the Abbot's liberality, nor did he believe that his purſe was ſtrong enough to furniſh the ſum which he pretended to expect. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing he had paſs'd his word to his Miſtreſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that Abbot, and that ſhe daily preſſed him to be as good as his word, he muſt needs at length have condeſcended to do it. But that he might ſo order matters, that ſhe ſhould for the future, pray him as much not to give the Benefice to the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin,</hi> as ſhe had till then preſſed him to the contrary, and by the ſame means have leiſure to wait the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Fop, of ſome better ſtock than that Abbot (and that was I, as the Devil would have it) I'll tell you the trick he deviſed. As there are no Maids who have not played Pranks, ſome greater, ſome leſs, but always enough to give occaſion of ſpeaking ill of them, when they come to be known.—</p>
               <p>Take it among you Ladies, cried the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Montal;</hi> the Solicitor ſpeaks to You
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100358:87"/>now. O! We underſtand well, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> and we perceive he revenges himſelf on us; but have a little patience. Alas! Madamoiſelle, Pardon me, replied the little Man, I ſpake without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I ſaid. Nay, pray, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> Proceed, Mr. Solicitor, and fear no colours; had you ſaid as much truth all your life time, as you have now ſpoken, there could not be an honeſter Lawyer in the World than your ſelf. Hold there, good Chevalier, replied Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> giving him a knock with her Fork on the fingers, You are very pleaſant, in ſaying that there is no vertuous Maid. I ſaid it not in theſe terms, continued he; but ſeeing you give me an example, I think I ſhould not lye if I ſaid ſo; yea, and in my opinion, there is nothing truer. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent man! cried Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> and then addreſſing her ſelf to the Judge, What do you think, Sir, ſaid ſhe, Should we not take this man and drown him? Do ye hear, replied the good old Man, There is no body but your ſelves that know whether he have Reaſon or not. How then! ſaid Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Velzers,</hi> Do you alſo queſtion our Vertue? And are you afraid to be miſtaken, if you ſpeak to our advantage? Not ſo, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, but I ſay that Monſieur the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier muſt needs be acquainted with your
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100358:88"/>Intrigue, in ſaying what he ſayes. Alas Sir, ſaid <hi>Montal</hi> driely, there is not one of the four, you ſee, but I would raile againſt, if I had ſet my ſelf to it. What! ſaid Madam <hi>de Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> without excepting Madam <hi>D'arvianne,</hi> whom you never knew but to day? That's all one, replied he, I know her well enough to maintain that ſhe is the diſcreeteſt of all the four. That amiable indiſpoſed Lady, at theſe words bluſht a little, as if ſhe had known that he malitiouſly praiſed her diſcretion, becauſe ſometimes ſhe was apt to fall into ſome fits of folly; and the Marqueſs by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſignes rebuked the Chevalier for it. In the mean while the Judge ſaid, ye have all preſſed and tormented Monſieur <hi>Tigean</hi> to tell you his ſtory, and now ye are no more for it. How! anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> care we no more for it? we have not forgot where we ſtopt, and pretend not to have loſt any thing by the Foppery of the Chevalier. Maſter Solicitor, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> will excuſe me, I have not done him ſo great a diſ-kindneſs as is believed, and I have onely given him ſome time to recover a little cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from his plate; have at you, Monſieur <hi>Tigean,</hi> continued he knocking the Glaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his, a good Health to you. The good little man pledged him, and all the company being again compoſed to hear, he began to renew his diſcourſe in this manner:</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100358:88"/>
               <p>It ſeems it was my luck to ſuffer under the effect of that ſtratagem, which the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman contrived to take off his Miſtreſs from preſſing him any more to confer the benefice on the Abbot. Having then digged out of the Grave ſome calumnies that had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly raiſed of her; as for inſtance, that ſhe had been long in good terms with the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes Husband, and that one day when the Dutcheſs came unexpectedly back to her Chamber, ſhe had found the Duke ſo out of breath and in diſorder, and the maid ſo red, that there was ſome ground of ſuſpition that he had urged her, and that ſhe had defended her ſelf; having, I ſay, pickt up this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; the cunning <hi>Thoulouſian</hi> purpoſely let fall the matter, one day as they reaſoned together, asked her, if ſhe was well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Abbot, and if ſhe was ſure that he was her friend. O! anſwered ſhe, he is the beſt friend I have, and a man that would lay down his life for my concerns. Truſt him no more, replied the Knave, for he hath told me ſuch and ſuch things of you, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of gratitude, for the favour I am to ſhew him, in preſenting him to the Priory; as a true friend he hath done all he can to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me from marrying of you. I leave you to conſider what rage Miſtreſs <hi>Beffemont</hi> was in againſt the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin</hi> for this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100358:89"/>pretended treachery. Ah! Sir, cried ſhe, he is an Impoſtor, and ſince I muſt tell you ſo, a villain that hath alwayes made fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to me, and hath told you that out of Jealouſie; but if you love me, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me on him; and in ſtead of giving him the benefice, you will give him a hundred Baſtinado's. She ſaid this with terrible rage, becauſe the truth had perhaps offended her; and as people are apt to miſtake, ſhe imagined that no body but the Abbot could have told him theſe tydings; though he was all the while moſt innocent. On the other hand, my Cheat meeting the poor young man as he was coming out of his Lodgings, told him with the higheſt impudence: Monſieur Abbot, my Miſtreſs is furiouſly incenſed againſt you, and hath poſitively diſcharged me ever to preſent you to the benefice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have imployed ſome body to give me notice of calumnies that have been raiſed againſt her, and I adviſe you to remedy that before it take farther rooting; which he ſaid that he might incline him to go to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and that the Gentlewoman being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in rage, and uſing him roughly, they might effectually quarrel together, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened indeed; for as the poor Abbot was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her Chamber to Juſtifie himſelf, ſhe no ſooner ſaw him, but that ſhe took faſt hold of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100358:89"/>his hair, and having laid him on the floor, ſhe ſo kickt, beat, and tore him with her nailes, that the Neighbours were fain to come in and part them. Good God! ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſicux,</hi> there was poor <hi>Orpheus</hi> torne to pieces by a Nymph. It was what you pleaſe, replied the Solicitor, but the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin</hi> for revenge, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Notes warbled out all that he knew of her, in ſo much that he made the braveſt Lampoon that ever was, and the Knave that ſerved them the trick had the ſatisfaction to ſee them engaged together in a long and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious quarrel. Now it comes to my turn, and I am now to Act my part in the Play.</p>
               <p>Some dayes after, Madamoiſelle <hi>de Beffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> came to the Hall about ſome buſineſs, and ſeeing I was particularly acquainted with her, as ſhe ſtood by a Shop, I came to wait on her; Good morrow, ſaid I, Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, Good morrow: Well? when ſhall us Dance at your Wedding? Alas! Good Neighbour, anſwered ſhe, all is ſpoilt almoſt, and you can never imagine the baſe trick that the Abbot of St. <hi>Firmin</hi> hath played me; that Traytor, ſaid ſhe, to whom I freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all my ſecrets; with whom I uſed no Ceremonies, and whom I took for the beſt of friends, has gone and told fooleries to Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne</hi> to take him off from
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100358:90"/>marrying me: Gatzo! that's bad indeed, anſwered I, and he is in the wrong. It had been nothing, replied ſhe, if he had not been obliged to me; but it was to reward me for a Priory of three thouſand Livers a year that I was procuring for him; can there be a more unworthy piece of ingratitude? What were you procuring him a Priory of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers a year? replied I. Yes, yes, ſaid ſhe, dear Maſter <hi>Tigean,</hi> a Priory worth ſo much, to which Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne</hi> has the right of Preſentation, and which he left free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my diſpoſal. But really, ſaid I all in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze; do you forget that I am your humble Servant, and that beſides I am not unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thoſe who do me a kindneſs? why do you not think of me when ſuch fair caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities come in your way? you have heard me ſo often ſay that if I could obtain a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I would leave the Law? Alas! ſaid ſhe melting in tears, it ſhall be no bodies fault but your own, if he ever have it; and if you come not unto his place; for I ſhall die rather than conſent that he be preſented to it; and if by his artifices he carry it over my Belly, I ſhall object all the incapacities that may hinder him from the enjoyment of it: I know enough of his life to grin my point; and at this very preſent, he is kept by an old hypocrite, who every time that ſhe has a mind he ſhould go to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100358:90"/>a certain place of aſſignation, puts out at her Window a Waiffe of Linnen which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in paſſing by, and that ſerves them for notes of advice.</p>
               <p>The invention is not bad, ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres</hi> interrupting, and it is the way not to be betrayed by Servants. Do ye believe that then? ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Do I believe it Madam? ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> make no doubt of it. Yes, yes, I believe it very well, added Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> for there is nothing more damnable and wicked than ſome of theſe begot Hypocrites, and to me my ſelf, one of theſe mineing Sluts hath played a thouſand tricks; I ſhall tell you the ſtory when it comes to my turn to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>For my part, replied the Solicitor, I ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to provide my ſelf of a Priory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding what was told me of the Abbot of St, <hi>Firmin,</hi> and indeed I did not much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to ſuch things; for I never took pleaſure to hear tatles. I fancied that all that the Gentlewoman knew of him, was but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome counterfeit ſecret that he had told her, as it is uſual with thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cheat maides, to tell them tales and lucky adventures that they never had but in conceit, to the end that by this tacit ſetting off of their own merit and proweſs, they may wheedle them into a compliance.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:100358:91"/>
               <p>Ha! Maſter Solicitor, cryed the Chevalier at theſe words, you undo us with your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and you ſo diſcover all our Arts to theſe Ladies; that they will clearly ſee through them, when we come to make uſe of them in laying our Siege. It is true, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> theſe Trayterous men begin that way, when they dare not all of a ſudden ſpeak of their paſſion; they tell ſtories, as Maſter <hi>Tigean</hi> ſayes, and ſilly maids that would have ſcorned them if they had ſpoken point blanck of Love, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be affected by the example of thoſe chimerical adventures, by which they inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly inſtill the poiſon of their pernicious Maximes, which make vice virtue, and ſo maids undo themſelves. Good Madam, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> twice, be charitable to ſome, and believe at leaſt that ſome here, are not to be caught that way: Believe that ſome there are, to whom Monſieur <hi>le Chevalier</hi> may long enough brag of his happy adventures, before they can be tempted to encreaſe the number of them. I doubt of that, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Come, come Madam, ſaid the Chevalier bluntly, you are in the right, for ſhe that would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, would be the firſt to yield to be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that way. You want not vanity, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> and I believe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100358:91"/>is more inſenſible than you ſay. But Madam, added the fair <hi>Hollander,</hi> have theſe tales made ſometimes an impreſſion on you, ſeeing no body goes free? No, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, becauſe I was married ſo young that I was not capable of them; but I cannot tell what they might do if I were ſtill a maid, and that my buſineſs were not done. Ha, ha! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Velzers,</hi> it is then becauſe your buſineſs is done, I am glad of it. That made the Company laugh, and <hi>Montal</hi> that fool keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the matter on foot, y'faith, ſaid he, Monſieur Judge you may be very proud that you do Madams buſineſs ſo well.</p>
               <p>The good old man was half aſleep, when the blow was given him, upon which he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and bluſht at the ſame time. Ha! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, ye are all good people, and ye will never ſuffer a man to be melancholick in your Company. Upon that the Marqueſs ſpake again, becauſe he perceived alſo the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle man ready to fall aſleep: Gentlemen and Ladies, ſaid he, Maſter Solicitor will go to Bed, if you will not hear him, for he is almoſt aſleep. Ha! excuſe me, anſwered he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up briskly, excuſe me; I uſe not to be guilty of ſuch incivilities in ſo good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and if ye pleaſe, I ſhall end my ſtory. By all means, ſaid they, Maſter <hi>Tigean,</hi> we pray you do it.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:100358:92"/>
               <p>I preſſed then the maid, continued he, to bring me to the ſpeech of her Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne,</hi> who having proteſted to her that the calumnies of the Abbot had not in the leaſt leſſened his Love, made her the ſame complements in relation to me as he had done for the Abbot, and left all to her diſpoſal. I agreed to give him a preſent of four thouſand Livers in hand, for the furthering of my grant and ſucceſſion, wherein I was deſirous he ſhould have a ſhare; for a mark of the long friendſhip that had been between us. Which donation was one of the Simonies <hi>a la mode,</hi> by the nicety whereof men have found out the ſecret to avoid all other condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that of Gods Judgment, ſecuring themſelves in the opinions of men. And without doubt I ought to be very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to have loſt that money; for it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhould looſe it than hazard my own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are pious thoughts, Maſter <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean</hi> ſaid the Judge, and ſo long as you are in that mind, you cannot fail to regain your money. Alas Sir, anſwered he, I have no more thoughts of that. Then returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his ſtory: after that I had, ſaid he, made that fair donation, my Gentleman told me that he would not touch my money till I had well informed my ſelf of him; which the Traitor did, that he might engage me in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100358:92"/>honour to pay him inſtantly, as I did, telling him he feared me; but I did not think I had ſaid ſo much truth, then: Not but that I had been before informed of that Priory, nay I hae received an anſwer from the Convent, that Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne</hi> was really the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of it; but it was not the ſame <hi>Broyonne</hi> that we knew. However, having payed my money, and received my Preſentation from that Knave; I ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for my <hi>Bulls.</hi> In the mean time my man who waited only for my Crowns, that he might marry; eſpouſed the Nymph, who delivered him alſo her two thouſand Crowns, for which he gave a good Acquittance. We were the beſt friends in the World. I treated them daily; and was not well pleaſed when I was not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called Monſieur <hi>Prior.</hi> I therefore gave all my friends notice of my preferment, who wiſhed me joy; and there were none (no not ſo much as a Lady, (who would never own me for a kinſman whilſt I was a Solicitor) but began then with open Arms to receive me and call me Couſin, in hopes, perhaps, that the Priory might one day or other fall to one of their Children. Though my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney got me no more but that Illuſtrious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, it was ſomewhat however. Theſe publick rejoycings laſted at leaſt ſix weeks; at the end of which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100358:93"/>by the arrival of my <hi>Bulls.</hi> Then did Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne</hi> think it time that we ſhould be gone, that he might put me in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and at the ſame time carry his new Wife down to his eſtate in <hi>Languedock.</hi> I ſpent two dayes in receiving the Adieus and Complements of my friends, and asked every one that came to me, what is your buſineſs? what would you have me do for you? Which, I believe, procured me the greater number of Viſitants. Afterwards we ſet out for that brave Journey, whereof I was at all the charge alſo, giving every night over and above Muſick to the new married Couple, and to the maids of the Towns and Villages where we Lodged, that I might begin the Life of moſt other <hi>Benefictaries;</hi> and in this Jollity and Mirth we arrived at length within a dayes Journey of the Priory. There, our good man told us that he muſt needs go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might give orders for my recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and recommending his dear Wife to my care to bring her gently on in her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whom he affectionately took leave of; the Gallant ſhewed us a fair pair of heels, with my four thouſand Livers, and the two thouſand Crowns of the new Lady <hi>de Broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> and I doubt ſo long as we live, we ſhall never more ſee him. In the mean while, I continued my Journey next day with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100358:93"/>whom I inceſſantly thanked for the good Office ſhe had done me; to which ſhe ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf to make anſwer by other comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments full of ſo tender friendſhip, that I could not in gratitude forbear to ſhed Tears.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid <hi>Montal;</hi> being in that manner alone with a young Wife, did not Maſter So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor make a little Courtſhip to her? Alas, Alas! Sir, anſwered the good little man, had I offered to meddle in that, ſhe would have found me as great a Cheat in Love, as her Husband was in other matters; for no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, as to that affair, can be expected from my Age. But in fine, continued he, next day towards the Evening, we arrived at the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and having declared the cauſe of my coming, I was received with great joy and reſpect. Madam <hi>de Broyonne</hi> was Lodged in the Appartment appointed for Ladies that came there by chance; and for my ſelf, I was conducted with Pomp and Ceremony into the Lodgings of the Prior, where if I ſlept not well becauſe of the joy that I was in, I ſlept at leaſt better than the new Wife, who could not conjecture what was become of her Husband, and wherefore he was not as yet come to the Convent. The Monks being raviſhed, that their Patron had made choice of ſo beautiful a Wife, ſolaced her the beſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100358:94"/>way they could, and told her that he would come perhaps next morning betimes and ſurprize her abed; which was indeed true. But it was not the man we looked for, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne</hi> of <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> who returned from <hi>Paris</hi> much about the ſame time that we came from thence; and who was not a little at a ſtand to find himſelf married without knowing his Wife; and that he had preſented a Prior and could not remember the Perſon. He was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his pretended Wife, but ſhe knew him not, nor intended to know him. I was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought in preſence, and asked by what Authority I became to be Monſieur the Prior. I ſhewed my writings: The <hi>Bulls</hi> were true indeed, but the Preſentation was falſe, and therefore they told me I was a Cheat. Some youngſter Monks who loved to promote the Whipping trade, ſaid I deſerved honeſtly to fetch a walk about the Convent, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be referred to the ſecular Magiſtrate, that I might ſerve for an example: But the true Monſieur <hi>de Broyonne,</hi> who well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by our countenances that we had been cheated; ſaved the new married Wife and me from that affront, and all our reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was Patience.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:100358:94"/>
               <p>And this is, Ladies, the ſtory that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> had a mind to laugh at once more; but if ye will take my advice, ye ſhall all go to Bed, it will do you more good than all the reflexions that ye can make upon my adventure.</p>

            <p>ALL the Company followed the Counſel of little good-man <hi>Tigean.</hi> The Ladies a little weary, becauſe they had not ſlept well the night before, through their change of Bed, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew, in imitation of the Judge, who was already gone into his Chamber, without ſpeaking a word; and the Marqueſs of <hi>Riber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and Chevalier <hi>de Montal</hi> did the like. But next morning all met again in Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi>'s Chamber, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100358:95"/>how they were to ſpend that day, which was one of the faireſt days of Summer; there was none wanting but Monſieur <hi>de Lucheres,</hi> whoſe affairs had obliged him to be gone by break of day.</p>
            <p>A hundred kind of Recreations were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately propoſed; but the Company ſeeming puzled in their choice, Mr. <hi>Tigean</hi> reſolved the difficulty, telling them, that it was beſt to begin with a good Breakfaſt. Along then, ſaid the old Judge; Monſieur <hi>Tigean</hi> is in the right; we ſhall have ſome little thing made ready, and a glaſs of good Wine may give us counſel. Breakfaſt was inſtantly prepared in the Hall, whither all the Company went, and had their mirth awakened again with their appetite; but the little good-man the Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, would not be cheated a ſecond time, with another Glaſs which was offered him, and wherein the Wine as one carried it to his head, fell down into the foot of it. A Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at Law is not to be cheated twice at one time, ſaid he; it is his part to catch others. It is true, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux,</hi> laughing; how well did you catch the Man with the Priory? That's very true, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> we let paſs that Story laſt night, without lamenting Mr. <hi>Tigean</hi>'s misfortune. Alas! Poor Mr. <hi>Tigean,</hi> added ſhe; he is ſo honeſt a Man. Yes, I am very
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100358:96"/>apt to believe what you ſay, replied Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux.</hi> Oh! cried Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> No body doubts of it, and there he ſtands, who hath never been guilty of the leaſt trick, for the ſpace of forty years that he hath followed his profeſſion, which is a matter hardly to be thought. Ye make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to jeer my Solicitor, ſaid the Judge; but it is true, that without diſparagement to others, I never knew a more conſcientious Lawyer than the little good-man <hi>Tigean,</hi> and therefore it is that I love him. Monſieur, anſwered he, It is only your goodneſs, that makes you entertain ſo good an opinion of me. That's very well, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> who came to joyn in the Diſcourſe; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the good opinion you have of him, you ſhall ſee that Monſieur <hi>Tigean</hi> for all his conſcience, will not perhaps ſpare to comfort himſelf, for the loſs of his four thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, at the coſt of Mrs. <hi>Beffemont,</hi> whom he brought back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and will run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of cheating her, by making Love to her. Good God! Sir, replied briskly and pleaſantly the little Man, I am twice your Age, and am no Courtier; but for all I have ſaid, perhaps I might cheat her leſs than you cheat your Miſtreſſes; for all is not Gold that gliſters, and Women are not ſatisfied with words. At theſe words the Company burſt forth in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100358:96"/>laughter, and left <hi>Montal</hi> for a time in ſome confuſion, becauſe he expected no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partie. But in fine, Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> fearing that that Challenge of the Solicitor, might draw the Chevalier into a Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little too free, as the matter ſeemed to engage him to, diverted him, by ſtarting another Diſcourſe. Well then, ſaid ſhe, What ſhall we do to day? Shall we fall to our Stories again? Every body hath not obeyed the Law that we made yeſterday. No, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> who till then pleaſantly entertained <hi>Clelia;</hi> and it is your ſelf that is in the fault. Ah! For my part, replied ſhe, I know not any; my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and I made no Love to one another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we married. But, Madam, ſaid the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, Have you never had a Lover ſince you were married? Saving the reſpect that is due to Monſieur the Judge, added he, drollingly, your eyes were never made for the face of a Lady that ſhould live to this time without Pretenders; and if I thought that you had never had any, I would from this inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your Gallant my ſelf, even in your Husband's preſence. Sir, replied the Judge, ſmiling, Do her not that Honour; I aſſure you ſhe has others beſides you, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate too. I love Monſieur the Judge, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> for being ſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100358:97"/>candid and ſincere. Well, Madam, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, ſpeaking to Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> You ſhall tell us then, if you pleaſe, the Hiſtory of your Gallants, ſince you are not deſtitute, and you cannot pretend to be exempted from the Law, which hath obliged others to relate their Adventures. Ha! anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> It was I that made the Law, and the Law-giver is above it. However, it is our intention, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> that it ſhall be above you, and that you ſhall tell us even at this inſtant, who theſe Lovers are; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways we ſhall give it out, that you manage ſuch ſhameful Intrigues, as you dare not avow. Ah! ſaid the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> I believe that is the thing that Monſieur the Judge fears leaſt, and that he has no diſtruſt of Madam. <hi>Mafoy,</hi> ſaid the good old Man, Fortune is all in theſe affairs, and Women are loyal or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal, as occaſion offers. <hi>Lucretia</hi> was the moſt ſtedfaſt Lady of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet ſhe yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before ſhe killed her ſelf. To theſe words Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> would have anſwered; but fair Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Arvianne,</hi> who heard ill ſpoken of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> took up the cudgels, and told him, that he ought not to injure the reputation of that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, and that in good earneſt he was miſtaken; for the poor young Lady was by degrees falling again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Fits. In the mean time the Judge,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100358:97"/>(who knew nothing as yet of the fancies to which ſhe was ſubject, and whom they could not, or rather maliciouſly would not tell, that ſhe was hypocondriack, to the end they might have the pleaſure of the Diſpute) maintained ſtill that <hi>Lucretia</hi> only killed her ſelf, for ſhame that ſhe had granted what was deſired from her. Madamoiſelle ſharply maintained that it was falſe; which for ſome time he took much like a Gentleman, but at length began to be vexed, thinking ſhe deſigned to make him ridiculous. He told her however firſt, That in <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and in all the other Hiſtorians, who had ſpoken of that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, what he ſaid appear'd upon record; but ſhe made him anſwer, That <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and all the reſt lyed; and as he was about to open his mouth to ſay ſomething, Go, go, ſaid ſhe, all in a rage; that's an infamous Calumny, and no body but an old corrupted Senator like your ſelf, who hath always been in the Faction of the Kings, and is an enemy to the Liberty of the People, would have in that manner diſhonoured the memory of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity it ſelf. There was ground enough to ſuſpect, that ſhe who made ſuch reproaches, had not her wits in a right frame; but the good Man was quite beſide himſelf, to ſee that the Company inſtead of informing him, were ready to die for laughter. He began likewiſe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100358:98"/>to imagine, that ſhe upbraided him for having been loyal to the King, during the Siege of <hi>Paris,</hi> whereas the melancholick Lady took him for a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator. This Point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was very nice, made his Colour riſe; and he told her, that he did not at all repent his being againſt the Rebels, and that he would be a Servant to the King to his laſt breath. The Fits of laughter redoubling at all theſe <hi>quids pro quo's,</hi> redoubled likewiſe his diſorder; inſomuch that being mad againſt all the Company, and filled with a terrible rage, he made a ſign to the little Solicitor, to follow him out of the Hall, cauſed the Horſes be put into the Coach, and before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (who laughed ſtill as they ſearched for him in places where he was not) could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his deſign, he took his journey back again to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length fearing his departure might vex Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> of a ſudden they mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their laughter, which till then nothing could repreſs; but when they found that the Lady was not much troubled at it, they ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe to diſquiet themſelves; and ſaid, that they ſhould thereby have more liberty to do what they thought fit; ſhe her ſelf ſaid, that it would give her occaſion to tell the Company the Story of her Lovers, which ſhe would never have related in her Husband's
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100358:98"/>preſence. In the mean time ſhe gave order, that care ſhould be taken of the indiſpoſed Lady: The anger which the intereſt of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> put this poor Maid into, made the Fit of her Fever more violent than the laſt ſhe had had, and it was both a pity and pleaſure, to hear the complaints which ſhe ſtill made againſt Monſieur the Judge, becauſe he had ſpoken againſt <hi>Lucretia.</hi> But that which gave greateſt amazement was, that Monſieur the Marqueſs would needs ſtay by her, bring her her Broth himſelf, and attend her with ſo much care, that it behoved them to pull him from thence, to oblige him to joyn the Company again, who deſigned to go dine in the little Grove; and yet he had not condeſcended to that, had it not been chiefly, that he might leave <hi>Clelia</hi> in a condition of ſleeping more freely, if ſhe ſhould chance to incline to reſt.</p>
            <p>The Company fell to play upon him at a pretty diſtance, when they ſaw him come forth of the ſick Lady's Chamber; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> told him, What? I ſee then, Monſieur the Marqueſs, you are in earneſt; but have a care, it's no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have Mr. <hi>Aronces</hi> for a Rival; and I would not adviſe you to go on ſo far in your Love, leſt you be not able to come off again when you have a mind. Add not to the fear
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100358:99"/>that I am in already, anſwered he, ſmiling; I doubt that I ſhall love her at long run more than I would, and that ſhe will not anſwer it as I could wiſh. That will be a great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> and if the example of an unfortunate Lover of mine, can contribute any thing to your Cure, while yet it is time, I offer my ſelf to tell you inſtantly the Story, poor Monſieur Marqueſs. Well then, tell it, Madam, anſwered he, with a tender Love as ſhe had ſpoken to him. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all of you then, ſaid ſhe, turning to <hi>Montal,</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed together ſoftly; and after began in this manner.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF Monſieur <hi>de Graumont,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Was laſt Winter at a Ball, where was a very handſom young Gentleman, who attracted the Looks of all the Company, by reaſon of his Beauty and good Meen; it is enough that I tell you I admired him alſo. He took me out to dance, and by his pretty Flouriſhes of Diſcourſe, increaſed the eſteem I had for him; but a quarter of an hour after, I found my ſelf ill, by having ſuffered him to ſit ſo near me: Yet let not this be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either to his or my diſadvantage; for the reaſon was, becauſe he carried about him a certain perfume of Roſes, which by a whimſey
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100358:100"/>of Conſtitution I could never endure; and the ſmell of that ſtirred up ſome Vapours, which joyning to my Sickneſs, obliged me to leave the Ball, that I might with all expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on return home. In the mean time I met with the ſtrangeſt Adventure that ever ye have heard. My Lacqueys having had no time to light their Torches, and being gone out to call my Coachman, another Coachman, who was aſleep in his Box, awaked at their call; the Fellow thinking they called him, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Name with my Coachman, brought up his Coach, not knowing what he did, ſo drowſie he was. I being miſtaken on my part as well as he, and my Diſtemper giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me no time to ask queſtions, I threw my ſelf into the Coach with my Maid; and in this manner, a little after, I was brought to the Houſe of another Man. The poor Maid that was with me was aſtoniſhed, when ſhe found the miſtake, and that nevertheleſs my Diſtemper grew worſe and worſe. The Coachman beſides took on terribly againſt us, fearing that that miſtake might put his Maſter out of all patience, if he came from the Ball, and found not his Coach. And to be ſhort, that Brute would have ſuffered me to die without relief; but by good fortune Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Graumont,</hi> the Mother of him whoſe Coach it was, being ſtill at play in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100358:100"/>with one of her Relations, ſent to know why the Coachman made ſo much noiſe; my Maid learning that there were Women in the Houſe, implored for me their help, and told my Name and the miſtake, entreating them that I might be laid upon a Bed. Madam <hi>de Graumont,</hi> one of the moſt obliging Ladies in the World, having heard the News, came down immediately with her Couſin, and cauſing her Son's Chamber-door to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was the next and moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a Fire to be kindled therein, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and at the ſame time regretting my condition, cauſed me to be laid on her Son's Bed, who upon his return was much ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to find a buckſom Woman on his Bed; for, ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, I am indifferently buckſom, and ſo much the rather, in regard her Son was the Gentleman, with whom I had dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Ball.</p>
               <p>How, Madam, ſaid the Marqueſs, Was it the lovely Youth then, of whom you ſpake in the beginning, that was the Son of the Houſe? Yes, replied ſhe, the very ſame, and his Name was Monſieur <hi>de Graumont</hi> alſo. Ah! ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> I impatiently expect to hear the Complement he made you. The ſame that perhaps you might have made me, if you had been in his place, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Y'faith! Madam, replied he,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100358:101"/>I doubt of that, and you will not ſay ſo; for I know very well what I ſhould have done, if I had found you in my Bed. That young Man, continued ſhe, was at leaſt as fooliſh as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; who like Monſieur the Chevalier <hi>de Montal,</hi> imagined that all Women ought to be in Love with him; who made impudence a vertue, and thought that to be the only way to ſpeed with us; who, in fine, had liked me at the Ball, that the Adventure may be the rarer, and who had committed terrible extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, as I have been told ſince, when he ſpoke of me to his Friends; came running like a mad man to his Bed, ſo ſoon as he knew that I was there, and whether I would or not, laying his face on mine. Ah! Madam, ſaid he to me, ſoftly enough, but with ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport, as aſtoniſhed his Mother, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended me; What is Love about to do with us? And who could have told me an hour ago, in the deſpair that your withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Ball put me into, that I ſhould find you again in my Bed, where perhaps, added he raſhly, with words intercepted by ſighs, my heart hath many times already wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you were in ſecret? That was a pretty vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, ſaid the Marqueſs, laughing. My Diſtemper oppreſſed me, replied ſhe, whilſt he told me all his Fopperies, and my ſenſes were almoſt all ſtupified by vapours which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100358:101"/>ſtifled me; but I aſſure you, that action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced not a little to bring me to my ſelf again; and I was ſo ſurprized, that I became redder than fire, for all I was ſo pale before. Sir, I anſwered him (finding ſtrength to thruſt him away, yet not before he had given me, as I think, three or four kiſſes) You have not, I ſay, well conſidered what you do, and I know not whom you take me to be: I attributed it only to chance, that I was unfortunately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another Houſe than mine own; but I find now at length, that the miſtake of the Coaches, is an Art you have deviſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me. Then finding that neither his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Maid, nor all the reſiſtance that I made, could hinder him from kiſſing me ſtill; Inſolent Man, cried I, Hold, or I ſhall make you know, that you have not to do with the perſon you think of. Madam <hi>de Graumont</hi> alſo chid him ſeverely; asked him what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery it was that I accuſed him of, and if he knew not that I was a Woman of Quality, who ought to be treated with more reſpect. My Maid being vexed at the affront he had done me, ſhew'd him likewiſe how much ſhe reſented it; ſo that the poor Youth, whom the exceſs of Love and good Fortune had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blinded, by offering him in his Bed a Woman whom he hated not, remained in great confuſion, when he began to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he had done.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:100358:102"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, he endeavoured to colour his action, and would needs have it thought a premeditated piece of Gallantry, that he might contribute, as he ſaid, to my Cure; for, added he, ſpeaking to Madam his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as briskly as he could; to be put to ſtrive againſt ſo rude a Kiſs, as that which I have given the Lady, is an excellent means to revive all the ſenſes, and there is nothing ſo good againſt fainting Fits. But when he ſaw that I caſt my ſelf down to the foot of the Bed, and that I prayed Madam <hi>de Grau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> to compleat my obligations to her, by ſending me home, he was, as it were, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtruck, and all his Gallantry vaniſhed. I believe he had the folly to imagine, that I was to be in his Bed all my life-time.</p>
               <p>He conducted me not back, for I would not ſuffer him; but next morning ſo ſoon as I was up, I received a Ticket from him; I cannot tell if I can relate it in the ſame terms; but however I ſhall do it as near as I can: And this was the Addreſs he gave it.</p>

For my part, I have done nothing, but think of you, and on the means to have you again in the ſame place where laſt Night you called me inſolent. Alas! Madam, you languiſhed there for pain; O that I might ſee you there languiſh for pleaſure. Are you one of thoſe that are offended when men love them with tranſport, and tell them of a ſudden the thoughts that their beauty hath produced? No, Madam, you have too much Wit, and you muſt needs love me. Yeſternight your Eyes ſpoke friendſhip to me concerning the matter; they told me indeed you were a moſt beautiful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: But they informed me likewiſe that I was a pretty handſome Youth, and they took pleaſure to behold me. Beſides I have been told that you have an old Husband. All that, Madam, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to you what you have to do. I muſt tell you likewiſe, that I am believed to be ſo Giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, that no body will ever ſuſpect that I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage any ſerious deſign. Let us loſe no time, Madam, it is the part of Maids only to ſuffer their Lovers to languiſh and they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes in it; but that is below a fair Woman.</hi>

               <p>That young man was a Fool; ſaid Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux.</hi> Not ſo, replied the Marqueſs, I rather believe he has gained his point with ſome Women by that liberty; for there are ſome who are won ten times ſooner by ſoolery and impudence, than by all the cares and ſecrecies that one could render them; and the Gallant imagined without doubt, that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> was to be caught that way. You have gheſſed right; ſaid the Marqueſs; but the miſchief was that impertinence never procured any thing from me but boxes; theſe words were directed to <hi>Montal,</hi> and that beſides, added ſhe, the young man was really in Love with me, which perhaps he never was with thoſe with whom he had ſucceeded. And that gave me occaſion alſo to revenge my ſelf ſufficiently on his inſolence; for in the rage into which his carriage put me, ſo ſoon as I perceived that he was in earneſt, there was no kind of fierceneſs nor ſlight which I did not uſe, a little to bring down his Pride. It was to no purpoſe for him to change his method with me, and to become at length as reſpectful and timerous, as he had been bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for I never gave him a pleaſant word: I undervalued alwayes the beſt things he ſaid; and favoured with my converſation all thoſe whom he thought inferiour to himſelf
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100358:103"/>in worth; ſhortly, I did him ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes, that about a month after, I was almoſt the cauſe of the death of a man, whom I had preferred to him in a Ball; and this is the account of that diſaſter.</p>
               <p>The Baron of <hi>Graumont</hi> (for he was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron) laid Siege to me continually, and whereſoever we happened to meet together, though Princeſſes were there, I had always his firſt Homage and reſpects. He thought then to have had me out to Dance the Brawl in the Ball; having even preferred me to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the Marchioneſs of <hi>Samee,</hi> who would have Danced it with him; but I refuſed him my hand, that I might give it to another of whom I knew he was Jealous, though he might as well have been Jealous of a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. My little Baron had much ado to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that affront, and I never paſſed him, when any one led the Brawl, wherein he had at length engaged with another, but that by the by he let fall ſome complaints, which teſtified his indignation. But ſeeing I was curious to know how far the patience of a man who had been ſo fickle, might go; (for I forgot to tell you that he ſcarcely loved his Miſtreſſes two dayes together) I put not there a ſtop to my cruelties; and having come to ask my hand again to Dance a Corrant, I gave it him indeed, that all the Company
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100358:104"/>might not be witneſſes of a little intrigue that concerned only us two; but I returned him not his Corrant, and when I was again taken out to Dance, I went and took out his happy Rival in ſtead of him, which was like to have put him in deſpair.</p>
               <p>Wherefore anger for ſome time took place of Love; and his Rival having given me the hand to lead me to the Coach, when the Ball was ended; Madam, ſaid he aloud and very fiercely, I have in my Pocket <hi>The Womens School,</hi> and you ſhall read it when you have a mind. I gheſſed what he meant by that, though he cited that <hi>Womens School</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently enough too; for being that which <hi>Moliere</hi> compoſed, it could not be applied to his purpoſe. It was enough to him, without doubt, to think that in ſpeaking of the School, it would be ſuppoſed that I deſerved to be ſent thither to learn manners; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe were his own words. His Rival, who thought himſelf obliged to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partie, told him very ſoberly; Sir, that is not the way to gain the Lady. Oh! that is moſt true, anſwered the little man in paſſion, and I know it very well; nor ſhall I ever gain her, if Heaven grant me not the favour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as great a Fool as you. From that they roſe to higher words, quarrelled, and both drew, but the Fool was ſtill Fool, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100358:104"/>delivered his Sword to the Baron, who in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain threw it back to him. In the mean time he that had the worſt was wounded, and the Combat made a noiſe. My Gallant was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to abſcond, ſo that I had ground to fear that abſence might make me loſe ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a Lover. Nevertheleſs I received next day another Note conceived much in theſe terms.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>Am hid, Madam, and I endeavour to eſcape the Death which men deſerve, that draw a Sword contrary to the Kings Laws, becauſe if I muſt die ſpeedily, I will have it to be only of Love; but I ſwear alſo that I ſhall die of it at your Feet, or that you ſhall uſe me more kindly. What, ungrateful Lady? I have ſighed more for you than for ten others. You are the firſt, (if it muſt be told) for whom I have felt true Love; I have been always preferred where I deſired it; and in the ſight of all people you prefer to me a Fool. Ah! I am in furious deſpair; and if ſuch a man as he deſerves your favours, I ſhall die for anger that I cannot ſlight them. At leaſt cruel Lady, believe that I write this with Tears of Love and Rage, for you have reduced me to a condition that deſerves pity; let it not be more
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100358:105"/>difficult for me one day to take from him your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than it was laſt night to take from him his Sword.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Letters, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> are really very pleaſant, and I begin to be pretty much in Love with that mutinous ſtyle: Well, what anſwer did you make to them? Very good! ſaid Madam <hi>de Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> you jeer me if you think that I was ſo much a Fool as to anſwer ſuch fopperies; would your Maids anſwer them? What hurt do you think would be in it, replied Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> were it only done for diverſion? for you did not receive theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as a Myſtery, but communicated them to your friends. Yes certainly that is true, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> however I preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to tear and throw them into the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Foot-boy that brought them, that he might tell him ſo much, to put my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in greater trouble; and for that end I burnt little pieces of other paper. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, interrupted the fair <hi>Hollander,</hi> did he intend to Droll, when he wrote to you in that fooliſh ſtyle? Not at all, anſwered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> he ſpake moſt ſincerely, and it was from the heart that he threatned or reproached me. Ah! replied the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Lady laughing, he was a Treaſure to you
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100358:105"/>Madam; and you muſt needs have had much pleaſure with a Gallant of that ſtamp: Yes, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> I had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enough by it in the beginning; but he tired me at length becauſe his Extravagancy went too far.</p>
               <p>There was no great trouble in taking up the matter of the Combat, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered but as a Ren-counter, and ſo my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant began to appear again. At what hour ſoever one had a mind to ſee the Baron <hi>de Graumont</hi> after that in our ſtreet, he might ſee him directly oppoſite to my Gate, lying in his couch in the poſture of a Fool, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Rivulet; and hardly did he leave his ſtation half an hour, to go Dine. None of my Lacqueys came out a Doors, but he called them and recommended to them to tell me ſomewhat at their return; and at length he prevailed ſo much, that Monſieur the Judge taking greater pity of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than I did, or if you will, out of policy, thought fitter to command me to receive him, than to ſee him continually planted there. I was all amazed when he himſelf brought him one day into my Chamber, where I was entertaining two Ladies of my acquaintance. A Malefactor carried before his Judge lookt not paler than that Martyr of Love did, and of purpoſe to encreaſe his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100358:106"/>pain, I told my Husband very ſeriouſly, do you know, Sir, whom you bring hithet, and that it is a man in Love with me, who daily commits a Thouſand Extravagancies? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered my poor Lover all ſhaking; Monſieur the Judge, is not Ignorant what violence you do to the Soul of thoſe who have once ſeen you; and if he approve not what I do, neither does he approve that you ſhould force a poor wretch to deſpair, who deſires nothing elſe but the happineſs to ſee you. No, Wife, added my Husband, who had much ado to forbear laughing, and ſeeing Monſieur the Baron deſires no more but to ſee you, let him ſee you as much as he pleaſes. With theſe words he left us all together.</p>
               <p>How Madam? ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux</hi> then, is it poſſible that ſo gallant and ſprightly a man as you deſcribed the Baron <hi>de Graumont</hi> to be in the beginning of your diſcourſe, could be ſo ſtupid, to ſee himſelf made the laughing-ſtock of any man without minding it, or at leaſt that ſhame and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not work his Cure? Theſe ſprightly blades, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſually the greateſt Fools, when they fall in Love to purpoſe. And beſides, know you not that Love growes ſtronger by reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? ye wonder at what you ſay, continued ſhe laughing, becauſe it may be ye have not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100358:106"/>reſiſted your Lovers ſo much as I did my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: But it is your own fault, and you are all Cheats. Madam, ſaid the Marqueſs, it is not at all neceſſary that all Ladies ſhould be as cruel as you, and put their Lovers to ſo hard a trial. For my part, replied Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne,</hi> I have no greater pleaſure than to ſee theſe inſolent and preſumptuous blades who have ſo good an opinion of themſelves, love without a ſutable return of affection; and I confeſs I reckon it one of my good fortunes that I had the advantage to reduce one of them deſperate. But Madam, ſaid the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Montal,</hi> who told you that your Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron did not counterfeit all the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he played, finding that there was need of Ceremonies to gain you? Ah! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> I aſſure you there was no counterfeiting in that, and you will preſently confeſs as much.</p>
               <p>My Lover having ſpent ſome months in following me whereſoever I went, without any ſucceſs, and without having even ever found an occaſion to his mind of ſpeaking to me in private; he reſolved one Evening to ſlip ſecretly into my Chamber, he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under my Bed, ſaw me undreſt at his eaſe, and go to Bed, and when he thought I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, he came and ſate down by my Beds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where he had the patience to wait un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100358:107"/>next Morning that I waked: And was he honeſt? ſaid the Chevalier; I think he was, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, or at leaſt I felt nothing to the contrary. When I awoke and ſaw him, I was not a little ſurprized; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my ſelf that if I ſhould cry out, and ſo render many witneſſes of that piece of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the matter might be variouſly interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Malitious people, thought I with my ſelf, may think of it what they pleaſe, and will ſay that I ſtayed till it was day before I cried out, without conſidering whether or not I might have been aſleep. Theſe good reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made me reſolve not to ſpeak a word of it; but only contrive ſome way to ſend him off without the knowledge of any but my Maid, whom I inſtantly called in, and whom I acquainted with my adventure. It was no eaſie matter for all that, to perſwade my Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to it, who falling on his knees by my Beds-ſide; Madam, ſaid he, I will not budge from hence till you have heard me. Befall you and me what may, I am reſolved to die if your diſdain continue, and he that intends only to die obſerves no meaſures. No Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I will not remove from this place unleſs you do me juſtice; I deſire only to be heard, and if you grant me not that ſlight favour, which you refuſe not to the meaneſt of men; tremble at the very thought of what my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100358:107"/>may force me to do. That threatening which ſeemed to me Ambiguous, made me very quickly promiſe to hear as long as he pleaſed, provided he gave me his word that he ſhould commit no Extravagancy. And then the Fool told me, I doubt not Madam, but that you have reaſon to complain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your ſelf on me. I have failed in the reſpect that was due to you; I have written to you with too much freedom. In fine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I took you for another, when I believed that you would as eaſily Love me as other Ladies have done; but I acknowledge my fault, Madam; is there no pardon for me? what delight have you to force me every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute to deſpair, becauſe you have found that it is impoſſible for me not to Love you? Oh! ſaid he, you take advantage on my miſery; for if you thought that I could ceaſe to Love you, you would perhaps fear to loſe me, you would comply a little with my humour, and not force it as you do to the moſt terrible of all extremities; and that, ſaid he, kiſſing my hand, notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance I could make, is one of the deteſtable Maximes of you Beauties. Why cannot I retrieve my heart? continued he; then returning to his diſcourſe again; I know, Madam, that the tranſports of Love which I fall into, are no ways pleaſing to you, and that you will never
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100358:108"/>entertain any favourable inclinations for me, ſo long as I commit the Follies that I fall into daily. Yes, yes, I put my ſelf in your place, and I well conceive that a Lover whoſe grief makes ſo much noiſe, is not made for ſuch a Lady as you; but help me to loſe that bad habit I have of complaining; leave off at leaſt for once to give me cauſe; be but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to uſe me no worſe than all thoſe whom you look upon with indifference. Well, ſaid I, you may take my word for it, I ſhall uſe you better for the future, only begone quickly; and I ſuffered him again to kiſs my hand, that I might oblige him to withdraw with greater diligence, ſo great was my fear leſt he might have been found in my Chamber; but the nicety of his Love made him conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure that all the favours I ſhewed him were only upon a deſign, and taking thereby a freſh occaſion of complaining; he importuned me a whole quarter of an hour longer with his grievances; but afterwards departed.</p>
               <p>I ſee nothing as yet, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> that ſhould convince me but that all was counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; a man might play the Fool and Mad-man more than all that, for the pleaſure of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his will of you. Nor is it by that yet, replied ſhe, that I pretend to convince you. He muſt firſt vex me, and by the ſatisfaction that he does me, you ſhall Judge if he was in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100358:108"/>earneſt or not; mind what comes after.</p>
               <p>He left my Chamber then, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conducted by my Maid out of the Houſe. That Girle ſo ordered matters that no body in the Family either ſaw or heard the leaſt paſſage; and he might have even avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eyes of thoſe that were abroad; but as he was half way out of the Gate, he fancied that he diſcovered his Fool at the end of the ſtreet; and indeed it was the very ſame, who was coming to paſs by my Gate, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty ſoever my Maid then made to him to ſlip into a Neighbouring Lane, before that the Gentleman whom he heard but did not ſee, ſhould have leiſure to perceive him; the Mad-man could be perſwaded to nothing, on the contrary he held her by the hand without the Gate, under the pretext of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring her to be his friend with me; gave his Rival time to come ſo near as to obſerve him; kiſſed again the Maids hand, that he might give the other ground to ſuſpect that it was mine, then letting the Maid retire; and fiercely Eying the other, who was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſurprized at what he had ſeen, he croſſed his way in the poſture of a Triumphant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. How is that! Madam, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs interrupting her, did he who was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Love of you; to whom you had juſt before given ſo good hopes, ſatisfie you in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100358:109"/>that manner to his own vanity, ſo ſoon as he was gone out of your ſight? It was not only done, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> but by one who nevertheleſs pretended to be much in Love. You have reaſon, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> my Baron was one of thoſe who though they play their Miſtreſſes an hundred idle Pranks, yet love them ſtill very well; his Aſcendant carried him to theſe vanities, and his face forced him whether he would or not to love me.</p>
               <p>The very ſame day I had notice given me of his Impertinency; for that Rival whom I had always uſed civilly to exaſperate the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, thought he had good ground to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; and having deferred his Journey till another day, he came to ſee me before I was dreſt, that he might upbraid me, for being leſs affected with his modeſty and reſpects, than with the inſolencies and impertinencies of <hi>Graumont,</hi> and gave me an account of all that he had ſeen. I confeſs I was ſurprized at it, becauſe I was ſo innocent as to imagine, that it was beſt to conceal that the Baron had paſſed the Night in my Chamber; but at length I judged it better to be the firſt in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it my ſelf, leſt the myſtery might otherways prove more dangerous, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I did.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:100358:109"/>
               <p>In the mean time, the other who was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with the thought of the fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that I had given him, to uſe him for the future more kindly, and had not in the leaſt conſidered, that his imprudence might have provoked me to anger, reſolved after Dinner to come and pay his reſpects to me; but ſo far I was from entertaining him with a better reception, as he expected, that I did not ſo much as look upon him: He asked my Maid the reaſon; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe knew nothing of it. He returned next day, and I cauſed my Gate to be ſhut againſt him: He waited until I went forth to Maſs; but ſo ſoon as I perceived him, I commanded the Coachman to put back, and reſolved rather to loſe Maſs that day. Inſomuch that falling into an exceſſive rage againſt me, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I made a Fool of him, he began again his Follies. Now I'll tell you very near the terms of a Note, which I received from him, upon occaſion that he had been told that I uſually laughed at, and made ſport of his Love.</p>

                     <head>For Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi>

                     <p>I <hi>Am told, Madam, that your excellent Wit ſeems pleaſed to laugh at my pains, and that in all places you make ſo pleaſing deſcriptions of me, as are not only ſufficient to make your ſelf, but even the moſt melancholick Company merry. I am not at all troubled, Madam, to be a Subject of Divertiſement to your ſelf and Friends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not of too long continuance; but call to mind, that there are ſome certain ſlights and contempts that produce cruel Tragedies; and that a Lover hath ſuffered a thouſand with patience, ſo long as they were ſecret or ſerious, who has not been able to endure a contempt ſhewed publickly, and with deriſion. I thought fit that you ſhould learn this from me, Madam, and that it is better of a ſudden to cut off the hopes that a Man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſometimes, than to amuſe him for ſport and recreation. I tell you no more. Farewel.</hi>

               <p>Still Threatnings? ſaid the Marqueſs. Yes, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> and by the By alſo very profitable Inſtructions; for though Rage did dictate theſe Notes, yet there can be nothing more wiſely conceived, than what he ſays he was willing that I ſhould learn of him: And for your ſakes, fair Ladies, added
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100358:110"/>ſhe, I make this moral Reflexion; Women muſt never amuſe and keep in play, thoſe whom they intend never to love. Why then, Madam, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers.</hi> Have you given ground to your Baron to reproach you with that? It is not my fault, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> he imagined without ground that I intended to amuſe him; for if I expreſſed any kindneſs for him, it was only to prevent him from committing ſome Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance in my Chamber, which would have diſpleaſed me; and to incline him more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpeedily to be gone. This is ſo true, that as I have already told you, he himſelf ſuſpected it. I agree with you, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers;</hi> but when we amuſe any one, it is alſo upon ſome conſideration, and ſometimes to prevent the Follies, which would not pleaſe us neither. There is no doubt of that, added Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux;</hi> and it is the men who amuſe themſelves, interpreting often our actions in a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſenſe than they ought. But let Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> make an end, that we may at length know what became of her Baron <hi>de Graumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seriouſly, continued ſhe, he terrified me by the threatnings he made of acting Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and diſtruſting a man of his humour, whom I ſaw continually fall into the exceſſes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100358:111"/>of ſo ſtrange a Folly, I deſired my Husband to rid me altogether of him, leſt at length he might do ſome miſchievous act. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in that reſolution, by the late example of a Maid whom a brutiſh Raſcal had poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he could not obtain her from her Father and Mother; and I thought with my ſelf, that it was no pleaſure to be expoſed to ſo dangerous Amours. My Husband there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding one day the Baron in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, told him plainly his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all that paſſed; and that Diſcourſe made the poor Youth ſo aſhamed, that he took a firm reſolution to cure himſelf of his Love, at the coſt of her to whom it was made; and this is the courſe he took to accompliſh his deſign with greater eaſe: There is nothing, ſaid he, but empty hopes of bending that Woman, that gives fewel to my flame. Come, let me outrage her in ſuch a manner, and out of humour do her ſo ſenſible an injury, that I may never have ground to expect pardon, and by conſequent a reciprocal affection. In this thought worthy of himſelf, he began next day to play the Man, fully diſ-engaged and at liberty; before me he affected a Jollity, like to that wherein I ſaw him at our firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; in the ſight of every body he talked to me familiarly, with a ſhow of the greateſt ſatisfaction imaginable; and all this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100358:111"/>to the end, that it might be thought my rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings were now at an end, as he had already made the report go. Inſomuch that being at a ſtand what to think of that new way of carriage, I conſidered ſome time if I ſhould be angry at it or not; but I quickly reſolved what to do; for ſo ſoon as I had ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of his Joy, which was the only thing perhaps he expected, that he might have occaſion to ſhape me an anſwer, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly fell down at my knees, and gave me aloud ſo abuſive thanks, that never was Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more amazed, nor in greater rage than I was. Good now! For what could he thank you? ſaid the Marqueſs. For what you pleaſe, anſwered ſhe; it is enough that I tell you he offended me ſo much, that I gave him a Box on the ear, much better laid on than that which Monſieur the Chevalier may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Let us wave that, Madam, ſaid <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> With all my heart, continued ſhe; but I am indeed an enemy of ſuch as talk idlely. Yet this was not a means to put a ſtop to the Follies of the Baron; on the contrary that Box perſwading him, that he ought not to obſerve meaſures any more with me, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to tell me ſo many offenſive things, and with ſo much contempt, that he ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his deſign of making me his irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemy. But I have my revenge alſo,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100358:112"/>and it is by this that I intend to prove to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Chevalier, that my Lover did not counterfeit folly and madneſs, that he might the better accompliſh his deſigns with me; he will judge by the ſequel, that when one is maſter of himſelf, he never takes ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate courſes, as the Baron was prompted to.</p>
               <p>After that he had atchieved his great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, he ſpent nine or ten days without the leaſt thought of Love. All his thoughts ran upon his Box on the ear. A ſhort abſence; the deſign of curing himſelf; the little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of obtaining his pardon; the reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he made on my faults and cruelties; on his own good aſpect, which deſerved more favourable uſage; and on the pleaſures that he found in his indifferency before he had ſeen me; all this made him believe that he was perfectly cured. He was the firſt that drolled upon himſelf, for the Extravagancies he had been guilty of, and that he could not conceive how he came to be ſo much and ſo long in Love. In fine, he was too happy, if his ill luck had not brought him afterward to a ſight of me, at the Houſe of a Lady of his Acquaintance and mine, to whom by chance I payed a Viſit whilſt he was there; but the defects that he found in me when he ſaw me not, appeared no more at next view; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100358:112"/>to him more beautiful than ever; he made a wrong conſtruction of a little diſorder that my hatred put me into upon the ſight of him; felt a ſenſible remorſe for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me, and his Love being all again in flame, he caſt himſelf on his knees before me a ſecond time, without ſpeaking a word, as a man ſtruck dumb with grief. I made at firſt as if I had not perceived it, turning as much as I could towards the Lady with whom I was entered in diſcourſe; but finding the matter laſt too long, and that I could not any more demean my ſelf as if I had not ſeen him, I roſe and took leave of the Lady, with as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied a countenance as poſſibly I could, and withdrew, as if I had not ſo much as minded what the Baron had done.</p>
               <p>I appeal to any, who have had the folly to think to cure a violent paſſion, by offending the perſon they loved, and who have miſſed their aim, if he was in a deſperate caſe or not. He continued like a ſtunn'd man, as I have been told, almoſt a quarter of an hour immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable, and the Lady whom I had been to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, after ſhe returned from bringing me to my Coach, found him ſtill on his knees in the ſame place. She comforted him, recompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mind the beſt way ſhe could, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him once more to write to me, which he did. But I cannot exactly call to mind that Letter, as I did the others; becauſe there were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100358:113"/>no more of thoſe brisk expreſſions in it, which for diverſion I loved to read over again to my Friends; and that to ſee him lament ſeriouſly, and like a Gentleman, eſpecially after the Jirk he had given me, was not the thing I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, becauſe I reſolved to have no pity on him. And therefore I read that fair Letter but once; and when two others that were with me when I received, and forced it from me out of curioſity, had done the like, I threw it into the fire.</p>
               <p>It deſerved tho to have been preſerved, that I might have thereby given you an inſtance, of the various tranſmutations of Love; for as I have told you, there was no more of that threatning ſtyle in it, it was in a ſtrain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to affect any Woman, that had not been ſo much incenſed as I was. He begg'd me pardon for his laſt inſolence, in terms which clearly ſhewed, that he could not without tears have couched them in writing. Judg, ſaid he, Madam, what deſperate Love may not force me to act againſt my ſelf, ſince it hath reduced me to that paſs, to ſeek a cure for it, by offending you as I have done. He confeſſed that he had juſtly incurred my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; that he had been too preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the beginning of his Amour; that a youthful tranſport had made him act in that manner, being deceived by ſome good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes on his raſhneſs with other Women,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100358:113"/>and that he had ſince fully changed that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent inclination. That at the inſtant he diſcovered my vertue and merit, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained nothing but ſubmiſſive reſpect for me; that he had not conceived any hopes or deſire, that might bring prejudice to that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; that he had loved me as an Angel might love me; and that if he had ſeemed guilty of ſome tranſports, which appeared inconſiſtent with the moderation of a man that loves in that manner, they were occaſioned by his grief, to ſee me obſtinate in refuſing to hear him, and in taking cognizance of the change that my vertue had wrought upon him: And then concluded by a thouſand oaths, that he would kill himſelf, upon the return of the perſon that carried the Letter, if he brought him not back word that I had pardoned him what was paſt; wherein he kept his word too religiouſly.</p>
               <p>How, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> did he kill himſelf? No; he did not kill himſelf outright, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> but he did at leaſt as much as was neceſſary for the work; and when my anſwer was brought back to him, that he ſhould have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready killed himſelf, and that he made too many words about it, they ſay he drew his Sword, and caſting himſelf upon it, run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite through the Body. Ah! He loves you, Madam, ſaid <hi>Montal</hi> then; and ſeeing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100358:114"/>he hath been ſo great a Fool as to kill himſelf, I make no more doubt of his Love. I knew very well, anſwered ſhe, that you would doubt no more of it, when I had once told you this circumſtance; for you told us yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day that Love might carry people to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. And were you no way affected at that accident, Madam? ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers.</hi> My paſſions were at that time too much divided, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> for me to be able to give you an account how I received that News. I trembled all over when I heard it; for the News of any man's death as well as his would trouble me; but my heart however felt a kind of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the thought that it would clear me from the Calumny, of having condeſcended to the will of the impertinent man, as he had the inſolence to give it out. I felt alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſolation, becauſe his ambiguous threats put me always in fear, that he had a mind to ſend me going unto the other World, and I was far better ſatisfied that he himſelf made the Journey. In the mean time his Mother ſoon after came to render me a Viſit, and to pray me to have ſome compaſſion of her Son; but, what would you have me do, ſaid I, Madam? you are too vertuous a Lady to deſire that I ſhould abuſe my Husband, and that's the thing your Son demands. We had a very pleaſant Diſcourſe on this ſubject,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100358:114"/>ſhe adjured me to find out ſome expedient for the Cure of her Son, without intereſting Monſieur <hi>de Moulionne</hi> or my ſelf in the affair, and I obſtinately refuſed to ſhew him any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But perceiving that ſhe deſired no more but the permiſſion to order him in my name to ſuffer his wound to be dreſſed, I told her ſhe might ſpeak in my name what ſhe pleaſed, and provided ſhe employed none of my Servants to do it; I was not concerned at what ever ſhe thought fit to ſay.</p>
               <p>Did he dye then at length? ſaid Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux.</hi> So far from that, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> that I found him next day at Maſs juſt over againſt me: The wound that he gave himſelf was not at all danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; a little remnant of Charity that people have for themſelves, without minding it, make them always chuſe places that are not mortal; and that poor Lover pierced only the fat of his ſide, which he had ſqueezed hard in his hand before he gave himſelf the thruſt, inſomuch that it proved but a wound to be cured eaſily with a penny-worth of Salve. And I failed not to tell him ſo when as I was going out of the Chappel, he came and ſpake to me of it; but I gave him a freſh ground of diſpleaſure, ſo ſenſible, that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to faint away for weakneſs, he fell down at the very door of the Chappel; that he might be revenged on me by the hubbub
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100358:115"/>that action would occaſion. I trouble you too long, with the Relation of his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies; he committed four or five more for ſome days time, and then reſolved to return into his Country, where now he hath been two months, and I deſire he may remain there untill I go fetch him back. However this is a fair example for Monſieur the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and the dangerous effects of Love in thoſe who cannot obtain a reciprocal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought to perſwade him to be careful how he ventures.</p>
               <p>Ha! Madam, cried Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> there is no compariſon to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Baron and Monſieur the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; and no Woman will ever uſe him as you have uſed that Extravagant. It's no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Madamoiſelle, ſaid the Marqueſs, I ſhall make the beſt uſe of that Example, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live a little more civilly with <hi>Clelia,</hi> that ſhe may not oblige me to kill my ſelf. But indeed, Madam, added he, you have told us a very wonderful Story; and I think ſtrange that it hath been ſo little talked of, that we could never learn it but from your own mouth. I wonder at it alſo, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> for it might have given ground to many Goſſipping tales; and Calumny is very modeſt in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> that it hath ſo ſecretly buried ſuch adventures.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100358:115"/>They have been ſufficiently talked of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Neighbours, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> but there are ſo few Perſons of Quality amongſt them, that Fame finds no mouths there, to carry the News of theſe tranſactions to Perſons of ſo much worth as you. And beſides, the beſt paſſage happened in preſence of ſome who were ſo much my friends as not to divulge them, knowing that I was not well pleaſed therewith. You had reaſon not to be well pleaſed with them, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid wittily the fair <hi>Hollander;</hi> for your cruelty would have got you a very ill name. You jeer, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> but probably you would not have had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy that I had to ſee a poor Lover ſuffer, eſpecially if he had pleaſed you as mine did the firſt time I ſaw him. For I am not ſo nice as not to confeſs, he ſeemed to me to be ſo Lovely a Youth, that when the vapours obliged me to withdraw from the Ball, my diſtemper was Augmented becauſe it depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me of the opportunity of ſeeing him ſo long as I deſired, one whom I did not diſlike. And it may be alſo, Madam, anſwered Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſicux,</hi> if he had not offended you, by thinking to obtain your Love at an eaſie rate; you would not have been ſo hard hearted as to have made him ſuffer ſo much? Ah! ſpare your <hi>May Bees,</hi> replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> though he had taken another
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100358:116"/>courſe, he ſhould have had no better ſucceſs; and I like not to be talked of; but your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that if You met with ſuch an adventure, continued ſhe, you would not be ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and I am glad to know your humor. Seriouſly, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> I would be ſorry that a man ſhould ſtab himſelf for love of me, or at leaſt I would not have him kill himſelf; that I might not be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pity him afterward. Nevertheleſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe, it is true your Baron did not take the right courſe to gain your Love.</p>
               <p>Ho! do ye think then, ſaid the Chevalier <hi>de Montal,</hi> that the Baron was in Love? or that his paſſion at leaſt may be called the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of true Love? No, ſaid the Marqueſs, and though there be no Lady more proper to Charm, than Madam, I ſhould rather call it a head-ſtrong effect of the Barons vanity, and of a violent deſire to ſurmount the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of her reſiſtance, than a real impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Love. For proof of this, it is certain that if Madam had but ſhewed him the leaſt favour, he would not have failed to have ranked her amongſt his other Conqueſts. Alas! ſaid ſhe laughing, you are in the right, and he did not deny it himſelf. I remember that he propoſed to me one day with the greateſt ſincerity imaginable, that I ſhould favour him out of pity, to the end he might Love me no more; was not he in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt?
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100358:116"/>adding that other ways he could never be able to refrain. I never had ſo great a mind to laugh as when he made me that Complement. You had indeed good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to laugh, replied the Marqueſs; yet he told you the truth. How, ſaid Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> would you make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any man could be ſo great a Rogue? the word is ſomewhat high indeed, but I cannot find a milder for ſuch blades; would you perſwade me, I ſay, that any man can be ſo baſe to cool ſo ſuddenly, after that he loved a Woman ſo ardently, as to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sword for her. There are ſome of a more ſingular humour than that, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; and ſince we are got upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I'll tell you a Story.</p>

               <head>NOVEL XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF THE Marqueſs of <hi>Franlieu,</hi> and of a Lady of <hi>La Flèche.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YE know the Marqueſs of <hi>Franlieu,</hi> who who is at preſent very Famous at Court for his Gallantries. That brave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being in <hi>Anjou</hi> before he bought his Place at Court; was dreaded there by the Husbands as much as here. As many fair Ladies as he ſaw, which is not rare in that Country; were ſo many hearts infallibly his own. The moſt haughty and fierce forgot all their Maximes of cruelty when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, and there was not any who deſired not to taſt a little of his friendſhip. In fine, he acquired a ſweet habit, of obtaining all that he deſired without ſo much as a ſigh, unleſs they were ſighs of Gallantry. But his good fortune continued not alwayes, and it began to forſake him at <hi>La Flêche.</hi> There the Marqueſs fell in Love with a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100358:117"/>and the Lady loved not the Marqueſs. The reſiſtance which ſhe made ſeemed to touch his honour, and the Lady ſtood on her points alſo to bring down the Pride of the Gallant. She brought him almoſt to the paſs that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> brought her Baron <hi>de Graumont;</hi> for after a whole year of aſſiduity, vexation, and pain, and after exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive charges, Love reduced poor <hi>Franlieu,</hi> to reſolve at laſt to ſtab himſelf if he could not bend her ſtiffneſs. He carried the Dagger to the Ladies Houſe, and hid it under the Toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of the fair one, that it might be ready when he ſtood in need of it. And as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had put him into his uſual deſpair, he thruſt his hand in a terrible rage under the Toylet to bring it out, and there is no doubt but if he had not been miſtaken, he would have ſtabbed himſelf without mercy; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the bloody weapon, he caught hold only of a Busk, (ſo great diſorder are mens minds in when they are about to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) and gave himſelf a mighty ſtab in the heart with it, which proved not Mortal.</p>
               <p>Ha, ha, that is exceeding Good! ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux.</hi> It was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no ſmall Love for the Lady, replied the Marqueſs, to have had ſo great tranſports as not to diſtinguiſh a Dagger from a Busk; and it is alſo a proof that ſhe drove him to no eaſie extremities, when ſhe reduced him to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100358:118"/>the condition of committing ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: For, added he, though the adventure of the Marqueſs of <hi>Franlieu</hi> occaſions more laughter than pity, yet the deſign alone is conſiderable: But obſerve alſo, Ladies, how he revenged himſelf on his cruel Miſtreſs, when that blow with the Busk had made her repent her diſdain. For ſhe perceiving by her Lovers behaviour, who fell at the ſame time into a ſwoon, that he was really in Love; and finding the Dagger afterward, ſhe judged that it was not his fault, if he had not kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, but the fault of the Busk which he found there. And as ſhe was reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe all the tedious dayes that he had ſpent, by that which might render a night agreeable to one that hath long ſighed for it; they ſay that he had hardly been with her the half of that ſweet night, but that he found himſelf in extraordinary great trouble that it was ſo long to day. The Lady who believed, and with good reaſon; for ſhe was very Lovely; that one ſhould rather wiſh the nights which ſhe beſtowed, longer than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; was ſtrangely amazed at his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, asked him the reaſon of it, and told him that without doubt, he found not the bleſſing for which he had ſighed ſo long, worth the trouble of enjoyment. But that was not the thing that occaſioned the Marqueſſes trouble. No, Madam, anſwered he, I tire not in your
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100358:118"/>Company; it is more ſecret Delicious, and Charming, than any that good fortune can ever offer me; but if you muſt know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is becauſe I am ſo overjoyed, and have had ſo great pleaſure, that my heart cannot contain ſo much at a time, and I wiſh it were day, that I might go and impart ſome of it to all my friends. How! Sir, replied ſhe, will you do me that affront then? I moſt humbly beg your pardon for it, Madam, ſaid he, but it muſt be ſo, I never Love, Sigh or Pine, but for the pleaſure of publiſhing the favours I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. The poor Lady wept, took on, added prayers, carreſſes, threats, and all that ſhe could to divert the Marqueſs from his deſign; but ſhe could obtain nothing from the fooliſh indiſcreet <hi>Franlieu;</hi> he made her anſwer that at leaſt he muſt intruſt the ſecret to the firſt he met; and ſo he left the Lady even before day, that he might ſatisfie that horrible itch of ſpeaking. By good luck, the firſt man he met was one that cried Brandy about the ſtreets, &amp; he was content to tell his adventure to that honeſt man, that ſo he might put the young deſolate thing to deſpair, who not knowing what ſhe did, followed him out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreet, and publiſhed, I think, her own ſhame, by accompanying <hi>Franlieu</hi> farther and farther, ſtill conjuring him to keep the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecret.</p>
               <p>How, Hath the Marqueſs of <hi>Franlieu</hi> been
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100358:119"/>guilty of that baſeneſs? ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers.</hi> Is he of that humour? And are there Ladies at Court ſuch Fools as to liſten to him? O! Do you think, anſwered the Chevalier <hi>de Montal,</hi> that the Miſſes at Court ſtand ſo much upon diſcretion? They deſire a great deal of Love; and as little ſecrecy as men pleaſe. There are even ſome Women, that would be vexed if men were ſo reſerved. Have ye not heard what has been ſaid of the Duke of <hi>Candalle,</hi> and of the Vice-Counteſs of <hi>Talut?</hi> No, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> and you bring us an example elder than any of us; the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> hath been dead ſo many years. But ſtill! What is it that is ſaid of him? I remember it, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Riberville,</hi> ſpeaking for <hi>Montal,</hi> and I'll tell you alſo that Tale.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>An Adventure of Monſieur, the Duke of <hi>Candalle.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT hath been reported, That the Duke of <hi>Candalle,</hi> after he had taken all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains to compaſs his deſigns with that Woman, whoſe Follies were not ſo publick at that time, as they have been ſince, got at length into her favours: And that as they were juſt about to withdraw, after they had ſpent the night together, ſhe made him take
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100358:119"/>a thouſand oaths, not to ſpeak a word of his good Fortune; Sir, ſhe ſaid to him, You will promiſe me then that you will not ſpeak a word of it? And the Duke having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſworn to perſwade the Lady, that he ſhould be more reſerved than he uſed to be on ſuch occaſions; ſhe anſwered him, Well, well! Sir, If you will not tell it, I'll tell it my ſelf; for it is too great an honour for me, to do a favour to ſuch a man as you, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mince the matter. This has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, Ladies. And in effect, the Vice-Counteſs of <hi>Talut,</hi> ſo ſoon as it was day, went and told all her Friends the kindneſs ſhe had ſhewed the Duke; but on deſign, ſay they, that by publiſhing it her ſelf in Raillery, no body might believe Monſieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi> if he chanced to ſpeak of it; but her cunning had bad ſucceſs, for they did her the honour to believe that what ſhe ſaid was true.</p>
                  <p>You would have, ſaid the Chevalier to the Marqueſs the Indiſcretion of that Vice Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, to have been an effect of ſome rational thought of hers; and for my part, I maintain it to have been an effect of her looſeneſs. But, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> you have ſpoken of the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> in ſuch a way, as it would ſeem, he was not diſcreet in his Amours; was he a man that bragg'd of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Favours? Bleſs me! ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> Expect you diſcretion and ſecrecy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100358:120"/>from handſom men? If their Beauty were ſo unfortunate, as not to afford them ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to tattle on, they would daily invent grounds of ſpeaking, and there is none of them but brags. Say not ſo, replied Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux;</hi> I have known one that ſuffered his. Head to be ſtruck off, rather than reveal the Favours that had been done him. Madamoiſelle has reaſon, continued the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; it is the Count of <hi>Bermilly</hi> ſhe means, and it is but a year ago ſince that happened. Alas! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> What I have heard already, hath made me very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret his Fortune, and I have a great curioſity to be informed of all the Story. You have much kindneſs then, Madam, for men that are ſecret and diſcreet in their Love, ſaid the Chevalier <hi>de Montal.</hi> In the mean time, if we may be believed, no men are more inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to you than theſe Blades; and you lament too much thoſe that are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I ſhould think them good for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, replied ſhe, laughing, could they be found daily, and could I but meet with one of them; but do not you perceive, that ſo ſoon as any of them appear in the World, they cut off their Heads? But, continued ſhe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her ſelf to Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> tell us a little how that misfortune befel the poor Count of <hi>Bermilly.</hi> I am going to tell you, anſwered Madamoiſelle <hi>de Barhiſieux.</hi>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF The Count of <hi>Bermilly.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Might make a long Hiſtory of the Amours of that poor Gentleman before I come to his tragical End; but ſeeing they are about to cover the Table, I ſhall abridge the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a few words.</p>
               <p>He was a handſome man, gallant, brave, and of great worth. One day as he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Law-ſuit in a Parliament-Town which I will not name, he had the honour to be loved by the Lady of a Preſident who was to be one of his Judges: That Lady who was no leſs lovely than himſelf, ſtood in need of no ſecond interview to make him in love alſo; ſo that that ſympathie for ſome time produced very pleaſant effects for both: They met together privately; talked and did whatever ye pleaſe. That little Commerce laſted at leaſt ſix Months without obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100358:121"/>on; but ſomething happened at long run which marr'd all the matter; too much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection ſpoil'd their affairs. There lived with the Preſidents Lady a Neece of her own, whom ſhe adviſed the Count to court, for the better concealing their Intrigue, and the greater convenience of ſeeing one another. He obeyed her counſel; a rival came in play who raiſed daily quarrels againſt the Count: He was forced to diſpute his Pretenſions to that Neece in appearance, to whom he had none in reality; their enmity became ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that it divided all the Town. Whileſt theſe matters were in hand, the Rival was one evening killed in the ſtreet where the Preſident lived. The Count was ſuſpected for it; next day he was apprehended; there were ſome <hi>Britons</hi> who made Oath they ſaw him commit the fact, and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; though the poor man was three leagues out of Town when the Murther was done, and that it was eaſie for him to have proved that he was imployed all that night in matters quite contrary to the killing of men.</p>
               <p>Sure enough, ſaid the Marqueſs, he was buſied with the Preſidents Lady? You have ſaid it, replyed <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and he choſe rather to loſe his head, than to ſave his life at the expence of that Ladies
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100358:121"/>Reputation; but the Chevalier wags his head at it, (continued ſhe) and believes not this to be true. How come you your ſelf to believe it, anſwered he, if that Maſter-piece of Secrecy hath told nothing thereof? There is repugnancy in all you have ſaid; for if the matter hath been kept ſecret, no body can know it. Ha! Sir, replyed ſhe, neither was it diſcovered till long after, by the means of a Chamber-maid that was in the Plot, to whom the Preſidents Lady hath done ſome bad Offices ſince. But, replyed he, might not that have been done out of ſpight by the Chamber-maid? It is very well known, ſuch Sluts can ſay and doe miſchief enough when they are offended. Nay, ſaid ſhe, there is nothing more true than what you have been told; the Murtherer has been apprehended ſince, and hath at his death publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Count was no way guilty of the murther of his Rival; but that it was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely, becauſe having been abuſed by him, he could no other way be revenged. The Chevalier is onely incredulous, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> becauſe he is not the man that would doe what the Count of <hi>Bermilly</hi> did. How I, replyed he? no, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, and I have no ſuch kindneſs for Wives that abuſe their Husbands as to do them ſo good an Office; If it were for a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100358:122"/>Maid, ſomewhat might be done, ſaid he, looking on <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers;</hi> it is no great Crime in her to favour a Gallant, and if ſhe had made choice of me, I could die rather than tell it; but for Wives, fy! their infamy cannot be publiſhed too much. You become a Saint, when the queſtion is of dying, ſaid the Marqueſs to him, and you are like thoſe old Debauchees, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entertain a good thought but at that hour.</p>
               <p>Theſe words were hardly ended when din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was brought, and they dined delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the freſh ſhade of the Grove. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they conſulted how they ſhould ſpend the reſt of the day. The Camp that was lately in the plain of <hi>Trevers,</hi> ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, is now at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and if ye will follow my advice, we will go ſee the Troops muſter this Evening, and afterward return to <hi>Vaux.</hi> With all my heart, ſaid <hi>Madam de Moulionne;</hi> but do you not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that you leave <hi>Clelia</hi> here? Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he, I beg that fair ones Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I had almoſt forgot her. We will carry her along with us, continued he, and that divertiſement perhaps may do her more good than Solitude. Theſe are your Lovers a-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> who love ſo long as they are in Company with a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100358:122"/>Mind; but let them be but a quarter of an hour out of ſight, and they think on her no more. He pocketed up ſome other Jeaſts, for the Infidelity he had committed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding it; afterward, they went to ſee how the ſick <hi>Clelia</hi> did, and if ſhe was in a Condition to go with the Company. Her Fit was not fully over, and ſhe remained ſtill in a deep Melancholy, which made them for ſome time doubt, if they ſhould propoſe to her to go abroad ſo ſoon; but the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had the care of her, who juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſmiſſed her Aunts Foot-boy, ſaid, that on the contrary to take the air by going thither, might divert her, and that ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf to have a great deſire to be at <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi> So, about Four of the Clock they took Coach, and directed their way to Court, where they arrived two hours after.</p>
               <p>All the Troops of the Kings Houſhold were drawn up in a line from the Pine-trees which ſtand on the High-way, and had the houſe of <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> in Front; nothing was ever in better Order. Monſieur the Marqueſs of <hi>Pegulin</hi> was placed on the ſide of the Campaigne, the <hi>Guard-du-camp</hi> at the head of his Dragoons with their blew Cloaks and Caps; and his three Troops made three very handſom and well equipped Squadrous. Next came the Duke of <hi>Nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illes</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:100358:123"/>at the head of four Squadrons of the Life-guard armed with Back and Breaſt and Buff-coats, whereon Gold and Silver Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydery was not ſpared, and who had all party-coloured Caps. After them came two Squadrons of the Kings Gendarms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Monſieur de la Salle,</hi> all likewiſe in rich Embroydery; as many Squadrons of light Horſe-men, under the command of the Marqueſs <hi>de Vannes</hi> Cornet; as many <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Gendarms, commanded by Monſieur <hi>de Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fueille;</hi> ſix Squadrons of Musketeers in white and black, led by <hi>Meſſieurs d' Artagnan</hi> and <hi>Colbert;</hi> two Squadrons of the Queens Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darms commanded by the Count of <hi>Kermeno,</hi> with as many light Horſe-men; two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons more of the Dolphins Gendarms, led by Monſieur <hi>de Richfort,</hi> with a third Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of light Horſe-men, which was a new recruit levied by Monſieur the Marqueſs of <hi>Lowvoy,</hi> conſiſting of threeſcore and fifteen, either reformed Officers, or old light Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with great Beards, and almoſt all of a ſtature, their Horſes likewiſe all of a height, and excellent Buffe-coats, the ſleeves laced with ſilver-lace; and there was nothing ſo much admired as that recruit, at the head of which was the Marqueſs <hi>de la Valiere:</hi> After all came three Squadrons of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darms and light Horſe-men of Monſieur the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100358:123"/>Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> And all theſe Troops had Tents of the ſame colour of their Caps ranked in good order. So that being made in the ſame manner as the <hi>Roman</hi> Tents are painted, they afforded new matter to the Imagination of <hi>Clelia</hi> to work upon, who without ſtrict examination of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons ſhe made, took the Camp for that of King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> where ſhe was detained as an Hoſtage.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> perceived it by ſome words ſhe let fall, and endeavoured by all means poſſible to diſſwade her from thinking ſo, leſt that might again put her into ſome new diſorder. Having alſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Court Ladies put themſelves in the habit of <hi>Amazones</hi> to follow the King to the Camp; he moved the fair Ladies of his Company to do as they did: and the more to divert his ſick <hi>Clelia,</hi> he took care to provide them with little flat Hats richly deckt, and other neceſſary ornaments, and fell himſelf to dreſs that lovely Maid, who by that divertiſement ſeemed in effect for ſome ſhort time to lay aſide her Melancholy; but whilſt he waited on her through the Camp, where ſhe charmed the eyes of every one, he could not hinder but that the ſight of the Tents, which reſembled ſtill the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven Tents in the Romance of <hi>Clelia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100358:124"/>again her former imagination that ſhe was kept in hoſtage, and that taking an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſave her ſelf, whil'ſt he was buſied in telling <hi>Madam de Moulionne</hi> the Names of ſome Officers that drew off, ſhe ſecretly and by degrees ſtole away from the Company, and rode at full ſpeed towards the great Canal which ſhe took for the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and whereinto ſhe threw her ſelf, that ſhe might ſwim over in imitation of <hi>Clelia</hi> whom ſhe believed her ſelf to be.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs who ſaw her no more, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that her retreat might be an effect of her diſtemper; but he was very far from gueſſing at the laſt adventure ſhe had had; and it was long before he would diſcover any thing of it. However, he and all the Company having made diligent ſearch after her, the news came to his ears; he learnt of ſome about the Canal, that ſhe had been ſeen with much precipitation to force her Horſe into the water, as if ſome body had purſued her; alſo, that a very fair and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young Gentleman ſeemed to follow her a little after, and ſeeing her fall from the Horſe as ſhe entred the Canal, ſhe had been infallibly drowned, if that Gentleman had not alighted and jumpt into the water in his Cloaths to reſcue her. All the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearing of this laſt extravagancy, grieved
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100358:124"/>extreamly that they had brought her to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> and the Marqueſs were in fear, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the fair ſick Lady might reproach them for having expoſed her to that diſaſter; but that was not the thing that troubled the Marqueſs moſt. He made it his buſineſs to inform himſelf more particularly of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he was told that the Gentleman had ſent for a Coach into which he put <hi>Clelia,</hi> and carried her away with him, which raiſed in him no ſmall Jealouſie. He made diligent ſearch in <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> and prayed the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier to do the like; they found the place where the people that belonged to the Coach had ſtopt, but they were informed that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving changed their Apparel, <hi>Clelia</hi> and the Gentleman haſtened into the Coach again, and that no body knew what way they had taken, which increaſed the Marqueſs his grief. He asked what that Gentlemans name was; but was anſwered that no body could tell; ſo that never man appeared more out of humour. <hi>Clelia</hi>'s old Governeſs made heavy complaints to the Company, and ſeemed ſo forlorn that ſhe would hear no reaſon; ſhe went away in rage, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care was taken to perſwade her ſtay till they had news of the Lady whom
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100358:125"/>ſhe had in charge, ſhe diſappeared. It is true that Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> calling to mind, what that old woman had done much alike two days before, when the Marqueſs believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Clelia</hi> carryed away, hoped that this laſt adventure might be as happily diſcuſſed as that of <hi>Vaux;</hi> and I am aſſured, ſaid ſhe to the Marqueſs, that the Gentleman is the ſame who told you the Story yeſterday Morning; he may have ſeen and known his Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man all alone, in the dreſs ſhe was in, and may have entreated ſome Lady of his friends to carry her back to her Aunt. But that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption was not enough to diſperſe the fears of the Marqueſs; and though ſo weak an appearance might have given him ſome comfort, yet it could not be long, ſince that Kinſman of the fair Maid was found ſhortly after at Court where he kept Guard, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no leſs troubled than the reſt at what had befallen her; inſomuch that they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to leave <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> before they received ſome intelligence; and ſeeing it was already late, the Ladies conſented to ſtay there all night, whil'ſt the men went to the houſe of <hi>Clelia</hi>'s Aunt; but they returned back as ill ſatisfied as they went, and brought no other news but a full aſſurance that the poor Maid was really carryed away; for her
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100358:125"/>Aunt was already informed of the matter, and they were told that ſhe went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately abroad to find ſome remedy to the diſorder, and to complain of it to the King himſelf.</p>

            <p>IT was impoſſible for the Marqueſs of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berville,</hi> to take any reſt that night, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that his grief for having loſt <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> was the Cauſe, or that he feared he might be called in Queſtion for the Rape, if the Author ſhould not be diſcovered. He would not ſo much as leave the Chevalier <hi>de Montals</hi> Chamber, to whom he talked of it continually; but at length the latter who had a mind to ſleep, told him, I am fully ſatisfied, Marqueſs, that you are really in love with that fool, and that ſhe has infected you with her fancies; for of a wiſe man that you were before, you are now become void of common Sence; why do you imagine that you can be called to an account for that Rape? Is it becauſe you are in love with her,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100358:126"/>and that it was known ſhe is with you? I muſt be alſo called to an account for it then, and all the Ladies that are with us; and beſides, do you imagine, that if that accident were not a deſign laid to remove a Maid from us, whoſe friends are unwilling that we ſhould make ſport of her follies, do you believe, I ſay, that that ſame Aunt, who, we are told, is come hither to complain, would not have been on her knees already before the King to beg Juſtice, or at leaſt would not have informed him of the matter? for in ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs there is not one night let ſlip, and it was the duty of that Aunt to have, at leaſt, given notice of her Arrival to the People of the Inne where your Heroine changed her Cloaths. Notwithſtanding we have been at the Inne, you have ſeen the King, and his Majeſty knows not ſo much as that any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath thrown her ſelf into the water. We paſſed again by the ſame Inne, and heard of no ſuch thing; and beſides all this, your fair one hath a Couſin here who is in love with her: All that he does, is to ſeem much afflicted at her adventure; without giving himſelf farther trouble; and is there not great probability then in what you fear? Your Reaſons are ſomewhat, anſwered the Marqueſs; but that which could not come to the Kings ears to day, becauſe he was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100358:127"/>buſied in ſeeing the Muſter of his forces, and which could not have many witneſſes, becauſe all people were in the Camp, may be more divulged to morrow, and the King may be informed of it; the Aunt alſo of Mademoiſelle <hi>d' Arvianne</hi> may very well deferre making her complaints till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Never fear, replyed the Chevalier, that that will ever wrong your affairs with the King; I tell you once again, that the Aunt, and they that have carryed away the Neece underſtand one another very well, and will never ſpeak a word of the matter: And for a mark that there is intelligence betwixt them; which way could that Aunt have been ſo ſoon informed of the accident, which ſhe was not onely informed of, but alſo gone to take ſome courſe about it, before we could get to her houſe? Ah! ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, that is no reaſon at all; the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Maid might have ſent an Expreſs to her ſo ſoon as ſhe left us, and we took horſe ſo long after, that ſhe had time enough to uſe that diligence. Well, let me alone, replyed <hi>Montal,</hi> let it be as it will, I muſt ſleep, and according as we ſhall find matters to morrow, we ſhall conſult how we may remedy what is amiſs. With that he ſunk down into his Bed, and the Marqueſs was neceſſitated to goe to his, having no body
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100358:127"/>to diſcourſe with any longer.</p>
            <p>Next morning, as ſoon as it was day, they met in the Ladies Apartment, and fell to diſcourſe again on the ſame ſubject. The company thought that the Marqueſs had no reaſon for his fears. On the contrary, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Chevalier <hi>de Montal</hi> who had jeered him for it already in the night time; they told him that none but the Lover of a <hi>Clelia</hi> would imagine himſelf anſwerable for the Rape, though others and not her Relations had carried her away. They went all afterward to Court, where they heard nothing of that matter; and then reſolved to return back to <hi>Vaux,</hi> and to tarry the reſt of the week there, that they might comfort the Marqueſs, (if occaſion ſo required) for the loſs he had ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>They arrived about Dinner time. In the mean time, the Servants of the houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, that at the ſame inſtant that they went to ſup at Madam <hi>de Moulionne's</hi> houſe, a Gentleman was found in a ſwoon in the Garden, by reaſon of a Spirit that had appeared to him as he was walking there. This is ſtrange, reply'd <hi>Montal,</hi> the World then is full of Enthuſiaſts, and are there ſuch fools as to dream of Fancies of that nature? Ah! anſwered Mademoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> here is your man of parts; and if we fall upon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100358:128"/>this ſubject, we may expect diſcourſe enough from him. And is there any thing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, replyed he, than that rational men ſhould give way to ſuch ravings? It may be the man of whom they ſpeak, has ſeen his ſhadow, and that is all. How! do you not believe Spirits then, Chevalier? ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting him. He? replyed Mademoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> who knows what he believes? I know, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> that I believe you to be the moſt unjuſt perſon living for entertaining ſuch thoughts of me; but heark you Marqueſs, that I may ſpeak to you freely, I'le tell you in a word what it is I believe. I have a moſt ſteadfaſt faith for all that my Confeſſor tells me I ſhould believe; and I agree that Spirits have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come back again, I never doubted of that; but to imagine that they appear now a dayes, or at leaſt ſo often as men ſay; I cannot brook it. I ſhall never believe that a Cat or Rat making a din by throwing down ſomething caſually; that a glimpſe of Moon-ſhine making Morice-dancers on a wall; and in a word, that all ſuch like things are Spirits of the other world. Good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> how ſoon would this man change his Language, if he had met with that which eight dayes agoe happened to the good man <hi>Santois,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100358:128"/>Alderman of <hi>Paris.</hi> Very well then! Madam, anſwered he, what happened to that ſame good man <hi>Santois</hi> the ancient Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Paris?</hi> Alas! replyed ſhe, looking on all the Company, there is nothing truer than what I am about to tell you, and that good man lives near to us, and is an honeſt man if ever was any.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HSTORY OF Monſieur <hi>Santois</hi> his Spright.</head>
               <p>WHilſt poor Monſieur <hi>Santois</hi> was at Prayers on Thurſday laſt, and as he intended to turn the leaf of his Book, he heard ſomewhat under his hand make a noiſe, and was all in a maze when he ſaw that it was the leaf torn out of it ſelf; but ſo neatly, that it ſeemed ſome body had done it on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In good time, ſaid the Chevalier, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100358:129"/>her, you tell me great wonders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! as if he had not torn it himſelf. O! not at all, replyed ſhe, and you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as much in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>At firſt the good old man had the ſame thoughts that you have, and believed he might have pluckt it out himſelf, without minding it, by reaſon of his ſerious intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but having turned over another leaf, and finding the ſame thing happen again, he began to be afraid, and rung his little Bell to call in his Children; they came all run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in, and he having told them how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went, they endeavoured to perſwade him that he was in ſome miſtake, and to bring him out of that place. But the good man unwilling to paſs for an Enthuſiaſt, reply'd, Well, children, ye ſhall be Judges your ſelves, if ſo be the Spirit is in a humour to tear a third leaf; for I would not have you think me Hypochondriack. Whereupon, opening his Book, he would have turned another leaf, and that leaf was torn as the reſt were. His Son-in-law, though convinced of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet ſtill averred that his Father-in-law had torn the leaf himſelf, for fear the old man might fall ſick upon it, if the matter were paſt all doubt; and alleadged for his reaſon, that neither his ſight nor feeling were good enough to diſcern whether he handled
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100358:129"/>the leaf roughly or not: But the old man being vexed, took his Spectacles, that he might try once more, and obſerve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more narrowly; and in ſight of all that were preſent, the Spectacles skipped off from his Noſe, and as if they had had wings, flew all alone about the room, then went through a window, and fell into a bed of flowers at the entrance of the Garden, where with the three leaves they were again found. What ſay you to that Maſter Incredulous? added Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, Madam, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> I ſhall believe it when I ſee it. But, replyed ſhe, it is a thing to be ſeen daily; for that Spright plays continually new pranks to the honeſt man. And beſides, that very Evening before we came from <hi>Paris,</hi> as he ſate down to Table, after he had tried on a new Suit, whereof the Doublet was of plain Tabby; the ſame Spirit in open view pinked it for him, better than any Taylour could have done; what do you anſwer to that now? That it loved pinked Doublets better than plain, ſaid <hi>Montal.</hi> You jeaſt at it, replyed ſhe; but when we return to <hi>Paris,</hi> you may go ſee it your ſelf. I will not go ſee it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, ſeeing I believe it not. I'le war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> he will have a care not to go thither. Is it not uſual
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100358:130"/>with theſe Blades of great wit to be more timorous than others? It is not that I am afraid, anſwered he; but becauſe if I went thither, it behoved me to believe that there were ſome poſſibility in the matter, and I believe no ſuch thing. But, replyed Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> honeſt people are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, when they ſay that they have ſeen a thing. Agreed, Madam, ſaid he; but name me any ſuch. Ah! ſaid ſhe, with all my heart, and I deſire no other but the Abbot of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat,</hi> to whom the late Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> appeared in an Alley at <hi>Tours.</hi> I crave no other but my Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Teſſau,</hi> whoſe Curtains he drew as ſhe lay in bed. Theſe are perſons of unqueſtionable credit, and would not for a world tell a lie. I make no doubt of that, replyed <hi>Montal;</hi> but have you that information from the Abbot and Marchioneſs, or from another hand? I have it onely, anſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> from one of their Friends; but he is a man as ſcrupulous as they that way, and would not tell a lie for all the world; and he that ſhould ſay otherwiſe, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me that Snow is black. Ah! as to that, Madam, replyed the Chevalier laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is the thing I leaſt of all doubt of, and it is eaſie to be ſeen. For all that, added he, I maintain, that he who hath told that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100358:130"/>tale has been but in Jeaſt, and that if the Abbot of <hi>Lauciat,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Teſſau</hi> were asked, they would ſay that I had reaſon. But according to your talk, Chevalier, ſaid the Marqueſs, interrupting him, you are a man then that will not believe what is ſaid of ſome Families where ſuch kind of Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are common? You will not then believe what is reported of the Houſe of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> where, as often as any one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is to die, there appears a Spirit in form of a great Statue of white Marble, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a woman, and runs all over the rooms of the Princes Palace? Neither will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there are two illuſtrious Families in <hi>France,</hi> the one in <hi>Bretanie,</hi> and the other in <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> where ſome ſuch thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens? I believe it, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> if you will aſſure me that you your ſelf believe it. But tell me a little, are the Princes of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi> as ancient as <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Dialogues?</hi> I cannot tell, anſwered the Marqueſs; and it is not impoſſible; but why do you ask me that queſtion? Becauſe, I think, replyed <hi>Montal,</hi> I have in <hi>Lucian</hi> read the Hiſtory of their Family; if there were any ſuch. Ah! ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>Velzers,</hi> Jeer not, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier; it is a thing I have heard my Father tell a hundred times; yea, and that a poor Page loſt his life by his imprudence in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100358:131"/>to hinder that Statue from coming up ſtairs. The young Lad had ſo great Love for his Maſter, that perceiving the Statue at the foot of the ſtairs, as he was going down with ſome others of the Princes Servants, and fearing that it was come for the Prince himſelf; Ah! cried he, wicked Spirit, you come to foretell the death of my Maſter, and forthwith gave it a ſound blow, which put the Spirit into ſo great a rage, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of him but with one hand, it daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his brains againſt the ground, before the reſt had time to perceive its deſign. Well then! theſe are matters of fact, added the Marqueſs, and that thing could not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without a great many witneſſes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more true, replyed <hi>Montal</hi> driely, <hi>Lucian</hi> hath likewiſe made mention of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of a Servant of <hi>Eucrates,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in ſtead of a Page it was a Groom, and that the Statue of <hi>Eucrates</hi> did not kill him that diſobliged it, but was ſatisfied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to drub him ſoundly. Ladies, ſaid the Marqueſs, there is nothing to be got by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with this incredulous man, we had better think of dining than of conteſting any longer. Ye are all, every one of you, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Montal,</hi> moſt ingenious perſons in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſuch idle fopperies? I would have you know, that no Spirits walk now adayes,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100358:131"/>unleſs it be to make Husbands Cuckolds, or for ſome other ſuch like Intrigue. After dinner I ſhall prove what I ſay by the Hiſtory of one whom Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> knows well; for the Gallant is one of her Relations. Let us dine then quickly, ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> that I may hear this pretty ſtory.</p>
               <p>I ſhall leave you to hear it by your ſelves, replyed the Marqueſs, whil'ſt I ride to the houſe of <hi>Clelia</hi>'s Aunt; for, added he, I ought at leaſt, having in ſome manner taken upon me the care of her Niece, go comfort and offer her my ſervices if ſhe have occaſion for them. An honeſt pretext, Monſieur the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> and we ſhall willingly give liberty to your love for two or three hours. Ah! Madam, ſaid he, the queſtion is not now of Love; and if I thought not my ſelf obliged in civility to doe ſo; I would not for the ſpace of one minute leave ſo amiable a Company as this. What you ſay, replyed Madam <hi>de Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> is the higheſt point of civility; but for all that, we believe you not; and it is very Juſt that you go ſee whither they have carried your heart. For my part, ſaid <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> waggiſhly, were I in the Marqueſs's place, I would not run the risk of going amongſt thoſe where I might be ſuſpected to be the raviſher; and I ſhould be afraid to be arreſted.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:100358:132"/>
               <p>They dined preſently after, and for all their railleries the Marqueſs took Horſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, and went to the place he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. In the mean while Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux</hi> challenged the Chevaliers Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; which he immediately performed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his diſcourſe to her in theſe terms.</p>

               <p>ABout the time that I came to <hi>Paris</hi> upon the account of my fanciful Locram-Lady which was in <hi>December</hi> laſt, your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Couſin the Marqueſs of <hi>Commor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gien</hi> came there alſo, and we both lodged together at the <hi>Hoſtel de Genlis</hi> in <hi>Dolphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet.</hi> We had good Company there, and amongſt others two new-married Perſons, which was a thing very ſuteable to your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins humour: The husband was a little ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100358:132"/>in years, the wife young and fair; the one a Block head of an ordinary Family; the other witty, and of great quality, but ſmall Fortune; and who had onely marryed that man becauſe he was rich.</p>
               <p>After five or ſix dayes converſation <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgien</hi> having made a ſufficient Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lady, he perceived her not fully ſatisfied with her Deſtiny. Her husband by reaſon of a little ſhortneſs of breath lay by himſelf, and allowed her but ten pieces a month for play; which was very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for a great Player, ſuch as ſhe was; And to ſee her ſelf tyed to an old husband, who though he had not been afflicted with ſhortneſs of breath, yet was ſtill old, gave her good cauſe to be no wayes ſatisfied. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgien</hi> proved it to her alſo by a Sonnet which he compoſed the day following. I have forgot it, becauſe it was very roguiſh; onely I remember it was an ill-made piece, in imitation of <hi>Petrarch,</hi> and which ended with theſe Verſes, ſpeaking of handſome women.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Nature has gi'n 'em ſtore of Wit,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Beauty and Graces joyn'd to it,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>In fine, ſh' has gi'n 'em all ſhe can,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But only hearts to love a weak old man.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:100358:133"/>
               <p>The Chevalier looks on me as he ſayes that, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting him, and theſe Verſes are addreſſed to me; but fear not for all that to marry old men, ſaid ſhe to the Maids, if you find any for your turn; I aſſure you, I am well ſatisfied with mine. Patience Madam, anſwered he, I do not attack you; why do you defend your ſelf? So much the worſe for you, added he; if you love an old man, you are the firſt that has done ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commorgien</hi> then ſhewed the Lady the Sonnet, continued he, and that Concluſion of it made her ſmile; ſo that being a man born with a kind of pity for all afflicted La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are handſome, and being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that ſmile, that ſhe might be inclined to receive conſolation; he diſplayed all his Rhetorick to give her what comfort he could. He went ſhares with her at all kinds of game, and eſpecially at Beaſt, whereat they played every Night in the <hi>Hoſtel de Genlis;</hi> and that was, ſaid he, one of thoſe rare fetches, wherein you know Mademoiſelle, your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin excells, <hi>to induce her to play at another Game with him.</hi> In fine, there was ſuch a certain Charm in the Money which for ſome dayes he laid down for her, that he made her laugh more than the Sonnet: Every time their Eyes met after that, whereſoever it was;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100358:133"/>the Lady ſmiling a little, looked down and turned about her head, as if ſhe feared to be obſerved by <hi>Commorgien;</hi> and on the other hand <hi>Commorgien</hi> loſt no time to give her dumb ſigns of his paſſion. But ſo ſoon as ſhe found that he had gueſſed at her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhe kept at a little more diſtance, that ſhe might make him ſet a value on that which ſhe did not intend to refuſe him.</p>
               <p>Obſerve a little, ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>Velzers</hi> in her turn, how theſe Gentlemen interpret the actions of poor women; and if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us not to take good heed how we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them.</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee, replyed he, that <hi>Commor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gien</hi> was not miſtaken. The Lady then, as if ſhe had been vexed that he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thinking that ſhe loved him, looked no more upon him but with a ſevere Aſpect. He was not at all ſurprized at the matter. Heaven has been ſo kind to him, as to make him very well acquainted with peoples hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. He uſed no other Charm to bring her to her ſelf again, but to ſeem as haughty as ſhe. She was more troubled at that, than he had been at all her affected Cruelties, and the truth of this appeared three dayes after; for as he met her <hi>en paſſant;</hi> It is very baſe, ſaid ſhe to him, for one to entertain a grudge againſt their Friends, and not to tell them
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100358:134"/>the reaſon of it. <hi>Commorgien</hi> would have anſwered; but the fair one ſeeing her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band coming at a diſtance, gave him no time for it. Go, continued ſhe, that way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage leſſens much the eſteem that I had of you, and I wiſh you concealed nothing in your thoughts that might diſpleaſe me. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhe went into her Chamber, and <hi>Commorgien</hi> withdrew that I might write her a ſhort Letter, which the ſame Evening as they were at Table he ſlipt into her Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Theſe were the words of it, for I have remembred them better than the Sonnet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Letter ſeemed to me to be of a better ſtrain.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SInce it is your pleaſure, Madam, that one ſhould keep nothing in his heart which may diſpleaſe you, I make haſte to tell you that I am paſſionately in love with you. This is the thing that I keep in my heart, which I think offends you moſt, and which may draw upon me your hatred, if it be longer concealed. I know not, Madam, how you will receive this Declaration; but you might have very well expected it the very firſt day I ſaw you. Affect not, I beſeech you, a cruelty which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100358:134"/>makes us loſe the moſt precious thing in the World, that is Time. The unlucky gaining of the Law ſuit which keeps you here, will be enough perhaps to ſeparate us, and then our eſteem for one another will be fruitleſs. To be ſhort, Madam, I have but three or four good words to adde. My Heart, my Life, my Money, my own and Friends credit, are at your Service; and beſides that, I promiſe you an inviolable Fidelity.</hi>

               <p>There is Juſt a Baron <hi>de Granmont,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Yes, anſwered the Chevalier; but he had not to doe with a wife of an old Judge, I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>This Love-note, (continued he, ſpeaking to all the company) was free enough, as ye ſee: However, it gave no diſtaſte; and by that it appears, that whatever that fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is pleaſed to ſay, the beſt way to ſpeed is to ſet roundly to work. The Lady wrote another to <hi>Commorgien,</hi> wherein ſhe indeed told him, that he was not diſcreet nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to write to her in ſuch terms; but ſhe afterward ſubjoyned, that ſhe pardoned his folly however, and that was enough. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they found the ſecret of pleaſing one another for ſome dayes. Happy had he been, if the Law-ſuit that is mentioned in the Note, had not obliged the Husband to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100358:135"/>follow the Court to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and if ſhe had not been forced to go thither with him. But there was a neceſſity for it, and to compleat his grief, that old Impertinent lodged in a Citizens houſe, where <hi>Commor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gien</hi> could find no accommodation; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he did ſo purpoſely, becauſe he began to be a little Jealous: It behoved them then to find out extraordinary Strategems, to come together in private, which Love at length ſuggeſted. The Lady talked of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that had frighted her in a Dream, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truely or no, I know not; yet I think it was but a fetch to give her Gallant a hint of what he was to doe, becauſe ſhe could not ſpeak to him but in company. She thought, ſhe ſaid, that the Spirit came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to her bed, and pulled the Cloaths off of her; ſometimes lay down by her; and to be ſhort, did all that ye may honeſtly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, fair Ladies, a Spirit is able to doe in imitation of a Body. One of her Lovers who was a gallant Abbot whom ſhe met with frequently, compoſed ſome Stanza's on that occaſion, which perhaps ye will be willing to hear read. I have a Copy of them in my Pocket, and I hope the digreſſion will not be tedious. He pretended that that Spirit was the effect of a Charm which he made uſe of, that he might come himſelf and ſee
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100358:135"/>her in bed, and the thought is not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>

               <p>How do you call the Abbot that made theſe Verſes? ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>de Barbiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux,</hi> is it not the Abbot of <hi>Ruper?</hi> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> and <hi>Commorgien</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:100358:136"/>would gladly have ſeen him hanged, every time that he went to the Ladies Lodgings, becauſe no body but he hindered them from ſpeaking together about their Affairs. And was the Abbot deeply in love with her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed She? Your ſelf ſhall be judge, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, for he never budged from her; and he it was that occaſioned all the diſorder that befell <hi>Commorgien,</hi> which I ſhall tell you at the end of my Story. I am glad, replyed Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Barbiſieux,</hi> that I have learnt that, and I ſhall ſoundly rattle that Abbot for it when I ſee him: Conſider a little Madam, ſaid ſhe to Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> who can one truſt to for the future, ſince the Abbot of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is not aſhamed to be in love?</p>
               <p>The Lady, continued <hi>Montal,</hi> talked then of that Spirit, adding that ſhe thought it came in and went out at her Chamber window, which ſhe would have been very glad the Marqueſs of <hi>Commorgien</hi> had endeavoured to do himſelf, as ſhe ſince confeſſed; but there was no probabilitie that he ſhould expoſe himſelf to enter a Chamber by windows which looked all to the Street, the Houſe was too near the Court, whither ſo many went and came in the night time. He obſerved, that under the hangings there was a neceſſary Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet in the wall, he thought he might do his buſiueſs far better, if he could hire the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100358:137"/>in the next Houſe, to which the ſame Wall ſerved, and make a hole on his ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Cloſet; he managed the affair and it took effect; for by good luck his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, beſides his own Trade would alſo play the Maſon: by means of a little piece of money, the Landlord not only gave conſent, but helped <hi>Commorgien</hi> to pierce the Wall; and the hole being made he plaſtered over a piece of board of the bigneſs of the hole with which he neatly ſhut the paſſage. The Husband had a hundred times viewed all his Wifes Chamber, and believed that the new piece was the former plaiſter, becauſe the Wall was new; and no body could ever have imagined that the hole which was ſhut ſo cloſe, could open and ſhut when one had a mind. You laugh, fair Ladies, ſaid he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting himſelf, and perhaps think that I forge a ſtory? Go on, ſaid they, if the thing be not true, it is at leaſt well invented; and the new Wall and Landlord Maſon come in very pat. They were two very neceſſary points to ſucceed in the deſign.</p>
               <p>It was by that means, continued he, that <hi>Commorgien</hi> renewed his Commerce; and to uſe greater circumſpection he never paſſed through his hole but in the diſguiſe of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherein ſome days afterward he had a lucky hit. A little Lacquey whilſt his Miſtreſs
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100358:137"/>was undreſſing, ſtole inter her Chamber that he might catch a nap under a Table covered with a Turkey work Carpet; he awoke not time enough to withdraw with the reſt, but awaking in the Night time, and lifting up the Carpet juſt as <hi>Commorgien</hi> was retiring, he ſaw him and was frighted; next day he told what he had ſeen, the Lady was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſecond him, ſaying, that in reality when ſhe ſaw that ſpirit in a dream, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her in the ſame ſhape that the little Lacquey ſaid. However ſhe would not ſeem to believe that the little Rogue had ſeen it when he was awake; for fear ſhe ſhould be obliged to ſeem timorous, and ſo might be adviſed to lie ſomewhere elſe. Her Husband nevertheleſs ordered her Chamber-Maid to lay her Bed at the foot of her Miſtreſſes Bed to keep her from fear. In the mean while he guarded himſelf by frequent Prayers, in caſe it was to him the Spirit had any thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend. On the other hand the Chamber-Maid was extreamly fearful of Spirits, and rather than incur the danger of ſeeing one, choſe to loſe her place and be gone; but her Miſtreſs who loved her, undeceived her, and having had many experiences of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſneſs of her humour, imparted to her the ſecret, and told her, that it was a real body and no ſpirit that haunted her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100358:138"/>And in this manner was that firſt croſs accident made good again; now ye ſhall hear of another.</p>
               <p>The Husband who as I told you lay by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was not too well accommodated with a Chamber; for ſeeing people are not lodged always as they could wiſh, in every place where the Court is kept, when it is out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he had beſides choſen to lodge at the Houſe of an ordinary Citizen; he was forced to ſtow himſelf into a little room at the end of a Gallery directly oppoſite to his Wifes Chamber. It rained very hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a whole Night, and that Chamber being none of the beſt, the rain came in to his very Bed. Juſt as he was about to call a Lacquey, the Chamber-Maid came out of her Miſtreſſes Chamber about a neceſſary concern, which gave him occaſion to go lie with his Wife. He gently drew the Curtains, and perceiving ſhe was aſleep, ſlipt down by her ſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out awaking her. In the mean while <hi>Commor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gien</hi> was got on the other ſide of the Lady, faſt as well as ſhe in an amorous ſleep; never were any in greater danger of being ſurpriſed in ſo nice a juncture. However Fortune that watched for them, gave the old man ſo much diſcretion as not to ſuſpect any hurt at that time; it made him ſo blind as not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Commorgien</hi> was in the Bed;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100358:138"/>though there was nothing more eaſy for one that had young Eyes, than to have ſeen him by a little glimmering Moon-ſhine that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a ſmall opening of the Curtains at the Beds feet; Fortune ſo ordered it alſo that the Chamber-Maid came back again without making the leaſt noiſe, went to Bed and fell aſleep without diſturbing any that might ask who was there. Nature had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the goodneſs to caſt the honeſt man quickly into a ſleep, that when <hi>Commorgien</hi> awoke he might be put into leſs confuſion, and more eaſily diſengage himſelf, for had it been otherways he would have been put to a ſtrange puzle. Where am I now, ſaid he to himſelf, ſo ſoon as he found what danger he was in; and by what Witchcraft is that Man come hither? I will not promiſe you, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the Spirit at that time was in no fear, that it had met with another. He ſlunk out of Bed however as quickly and ſoftly as he could, and upon all hazard, paſt thorugh his hole into his Landlords Houſe: and in that manner he fortunately eſcaped ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an adventure.</p>
               <p>Ah! <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Chevalier, ſaid <hi>Madam de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting him, your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Commorgien</hi> ought not to have come off on ſo eaſie terms; if you would have made the ſtory more plauſible and regular,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100358:139"/>the Husband ſhould have diſcovered all, and the Gallant put to his trumps to come off as well as he could by acting the Spirit. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive then Madam, replyed the Chevalier <hi>de Montal,</hi> that you are ſtill in the mind I forge a tale, but whether you believe it or not, it is downright truth, and if I do not ſtick to rules excuſe me: I am not obliged to ſay that things happened otherways than they did. You are in the right, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> make an end <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Chevalier. How did the Lady behave her ſelf? The Lady, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> came not off ſo well. She made account to hug and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs your Coſin when ſhe awoke, and in that miſtake ſpake and acted ſome little pranks and frolicks, that ſtrangely ſurpriſed her Husband; the good man was not wont to find her in ſo gay an humour, and to be ſhort, her luck was good, that the old man was pleaſed with theſe Gallantries, ſeeing in the merry humour ſhe was in, ſhe did not dream of being miſtaken. But this was not all, the Chamber-Maid perceiving it was day, and that there was ſome body ſtill in Bed with her Miſtreſs, had like to have ſpoil'd all; for thinking it was no other but your Coſin, ſhe came running half aſleep to the head of the Bed, and jogging the Husband very rudely, Alas! cryed ſhe, alas Sir, it is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100358:139"/>fair day-light. Well, what of all that? ſaid the Husband. The Maid finding her ſelf in a miſtake when ſhe heard his voice, looked about her without knowing where ſhe was, and wondering how he could come in and ſhe not know of it, ſhe was in a ſtrange maze to ſee <hi>Commorgien</hi> changed into her Maſter; having nevertheleſs her wits about her to make amends for her fault, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſurpriſe; Do you not ſee, ſaid ſhe to the old man, that the Spirit ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues me? The matter went no farther, and what ſhe ſaid was taken for good coin; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that that adventure gave the Marqueſs courage to come off again another time when he was as deeply engaged. The occaſion of that offered five or ſix days after, when the Husband was forced to leave his Wife alone at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> whilſt a neceſſary affair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called him to <hi>Paris:</hi> He intended to ſtay eight days there, but he tarryed but three: <hi>Commorgien</hi> was punctual to her in his viſits theſe three days, and by chance the Night that her Husband returned ſhe had prayed him to forbear his viſits: and that happened very luckily for her, becauſe of the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected return of her Husband, who being come back late at Night, and having gone ſtreight up to her Chamber, found her all alone; but brave <hi>Commorgiens</hi> luck was not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100358:140"/>ſo good; for ſeeing he believed that his Cuckold was ſtill at <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought he might without great danger break the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he had made to the Lady, not to viſit her that Night, the fancy took him in the head to creep through his hole; and he did it juſt as the Husband upon another fancy lay down by his Wife; the Moon ſhone ſtill, the Curtains were half open, and as the good man lay juſt ſo as he muſt needs look that way where the hole was; he was, poor old man, put into a terrible fright, when he ſaw your Coſin put his head through the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hangings. Ah! Wife, cryed he all ſhaking, (but as ſoftly as he could leſt the Spirit ſhould hear him) the Spirit is coming to appear to me alſo. The Spirit! Sir? anſwered ſhe, for the good Lady ſuſpected it was her uſual gueſt; ah! dear Husband added ſhe, throwing the Cloaths over his head; pray to God, and hide your ſelf in the Bed; when ever it appears to my Maid I take no other courſe but that to cure her fears; it is a ſtrange thing that it haunts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, and yet I never ſee it: but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe embracing and covering him with the Cloaths; have you well conſidered what you have ſeen? for to tell you truly, to this preſent I believed that (for all the noiſe I heard before my Maid came to lie in my Chamber)
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100358:140"/>what hath happened of late was nothing but the effect of her timorous imagination. With that ſhe jogged the Chamber-maids Bed with her foot, that ſhe might wake her to give a ſign to <hi>Commorgien</hi> to withdraw; but he was already in the Chamber; and as the poor Husband who was almoſt ſtifled between the ſheets, put out his noſe to take a little air, the Spirit opened the Curtains that he might go to Bed, thinking no body but the Lady to have been there; then cried out both Husband and Wife in conſort, <hi>God have mercy upon me!</hi> but with this difference how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the one begg'd it that he might be delivered from the Spirit, and the other in all probability that the matter might not be diſcovered. She was ſo much afraid of that, that being provoked becauſe contrary to his promiſe <hi>Commorgien</hi> came to ſee her that Night, and making however as if ſhe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to conjure the Spirit, <hi>In the name of God,</hi> cried ſhe, making ſigns ſtill that might ſhew ſhe was in paſſion, and which her Husband who was cloſe hid under the Cloaths could not obſerve; <hi>go ſpirit and if you come from God ſpeak, if from the Devil leave us in peace.</hi> Your illuſtrious Coſin, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> thought it convenient at that time to be of the Devils party, and to withdraw without ſpeaking; whereat the poor old man was
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100358:141"/>much troubled; for, ſaid he to his Wife, alas! that Soul is damned, ſeeing it ſpoke not a word. I muſt however, added he, get ſome godly people to lie here, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reaſon of its apparition; but you are very ſtout, ſaid he again to his Wife, that you durſt put your head above the Cloaths and offer to conjure it. If you had not been with me, anſwered ſhe, I ſhould not have done it, and it is your preſence that gave me that courage: ſhe did not tell a lie, and if he had underſtood her aright, he would have found it true.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Commorgien</hi> ſhut his hole, and next day there was nothing to be found but a ſolid piece of plaiſter, through which nothing but a Spirit could paſs; which confirmed the Husband in the reſolution of appointing ſome body to lie in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that might exorciſe the Spirit with the uſual formalities; for that end he made his Lady lie in another Chamber. <hi>Commorgien</hi> had notice given him, that he might avoid falling into the ſnare; but he was of a quite contrary opinion; and that if he appeared no more, it would be the way perhaps to ſpoil all, and therefore he reſolved he would, for another moſt important reaſon. The poor young Lady was ſix or ſeven Months gone with Child. She could not draw in her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100358:141"/>what care ſo ever ſhe took every time that a whimſey brought him to her Bed, to be at all concern'd in the getting. <hi>Commor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gien</hi> and ſhe had been for a long time in great perplexity how to conceal the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance; and were now much more puzled how to bring it to an iſſue without the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands knowledge. <hi>Commorgien</hi> thought that the occaſion offered fair to ſend the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Husband in Pilgrimage. He dreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up that he might appear before thoſe that were to conjure him, without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; he thruſt his head through the hole at the ſame hour that the Spirit was ſaid to appear. He told them in the language of the other World, that is to ſay, ſpeaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly from the pit of his ſtomach, that he was the Husbands elder Brother; that in his life time he had vowed a Journey to <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers</hi> in the City of <hi>Lions;</hi> and that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Brother, ſeeing he was his Heir, to depart within three days at fartheſt, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the vow in his ſtead, which was punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obeyed by the good Brother; and he left his Wife at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> to manage the Law Suit in his abſence.</p>
               <p>Brave indeed! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> our Lovers are like to have a fine time of it now. Not ſo fine as you think, replied <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> for the Lady lodged no longer in that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100358:142"/>Houſe. Her Husband begg'd of an old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs to entertain her at her Houſe until his return; a piece of circumſpection that mightily diſturbed the two Lovers, and it even made the Pilgrimage uſeleſs; for the young thing had as little liberty with that Lady as in her own Husbands Houſe, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had ſhe ſo much. However there is a remedy for every thing; and I'll tell you what courſe the Marqueſs of <hi>Commorgien</hi> took to avoid two accidents which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to be feared; the one that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might return before ſhe was brought to Bed; the other was the extream difficulty to get her out of the clutches of that Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might carry her to a place where ſhe might be deliver'd. He had ſome good Friends at <hi>Lions,</hi> and eſpecially a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman the moſt ſubtle, and one of the moſt agreeable humour of all that Country. You know him alſo, ſaid he to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> it is the Count <hi>de la Belovere;</hi> this man at the entreaty of <hi>Commorgien,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated himſelf dextrouſly into the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands acquaintance, ſo ſoon as he had notice given him of his arrival. And that he might be obliged to tarry at <hi>Lions</hi> till his friend had time to do his buſineſs; he for his part alſo raiſed a Spirit to haunt the Pilgrims Inn where the good man lodged. A Son of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100358:142"/>Innkeeper bribed as well as his Father, and informed of the intrigue, appeared to the poor Husband; but in a different ſhape to that wherein <hi>Commorgien</hi> appeared at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> but the mind of the old man being prepoſſeſſed, ſupplied that defect, and made it ſeem to him one and the ſame apparition. Next Morning the poor man asked his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord if that part of the Houſe where he had lodged him, was haunted. The Landlord who with good will ſeconded the Gentleman the friend of <hi>Commorgien;</hi> as well to deſerve his money, as becauſe it was his intereſt that the good man ſhould continue long at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in his Houſe; made him anſwer, that never any Spirit had walked in his Houſe, and that without doubt it was to himſelf, that the Spirit intended to ſpeak. Next day the Spirit appeared again a new, though he had perſwaded the Hoſt to lie by him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the Landlord having had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ask it why it came to diſturb them, it told them That it was ſtill the Soul of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Brother, who required Prayers and Maſs to be ſaid for it thirty ſix days together in the ſame place of <hi>Fourviers.</hi> This was faithfully promiſed, and the Spirit returned no more. Afterward the Gentleman accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Commorgiens</hi> inſtructions, wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of a Phyſician, acquainting
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100358:143"/>the young Lady that her Husband was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſick, and that he deſired to ſee her becauſe the event of his ſickneſs was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. This Letter being delivered to the big bellied Lady, gave her a pretext to leave her watchful Dragon. She took on terribly at the news, and ſaid ſhe would be gone with all expedition, and immediately took leave of the old Marchioneſs; who told her that ſhe had too juſt a reaſon of making haſt to be diſſwaded from it.</p>
               <p>And in reality it was time for her to be gone; for ſhe was not ten Leagues from St. <hi>Germans</hi> when ſhe felt the pains of labour, and was brought to Bed of a lovely little <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgien;</hi> who was preſently put out to Nurſe in a Village near the place. And to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the reaſon why the Lady ſtopped by the way, it was given out, that ſhe was fallen ſick of another Diſeaſe, which paſſed for good coin. She returned back afterwards to S. <hi>Germans</hi> to perfect her recovery. And under pretext that there was no convenience in the Houſe of the Marchioneſs, for a ſick perſon, in regard ſhe lived in a place too much frequented; ſhe hired again the haunted Chamber in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Houſe. In fine, the uſual time of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in being over, ſhe was perfectly cured: and the Husband who had punctually obeyed all that his Brothers Ghoſt had ordered him,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100358:143"/>returned alſo. He teſtified great regret to his Lady, that coming to his aſſiſtance on a falſe report, ſhe had thereby expoſed her ſelf to a dangerous ſickneſs on the way.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Spirit came no more through the hole, becauſe the Lady prayed him not to expoſe her again to a thouſand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that might happen thereupon; and <hi>Commorgien</hi> promiſed her to do what ſhe pleaſed. But a Spirit, Ladies, that has a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and is beloved of a beautiful woman, is a ſtrange thing. What Prayer ſoever may be made to it, it will ſtill be walking. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgien</hi> came back three or four times through his hole; there had been ſomething forgot in the Pilgrimage, and he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that the Husband ſhould begin it of new, that he might again for a ſhort time leave him the Coaſt clear. But the Husband began to wonder that the Spirit was ſo obſtinate in perſecuting him, and complained of it in all places: The Abbot who made the <hi>Stanza</hi>'s being mad, that he could not diſcover an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue which he too truly ſuſpected to be managed betwixt <hi>Commorgien</hi> and his fair one, came to underſtand what troubled the old man: and it being no Article of his Faith that Ghoſts appeared often; he prayed the old Husband to ſhew him the place through which the Soul of his Brother appeared. He
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100358:144"/>made no doubt but that it was ſome trick on the part of <hi>Commorgien,</hi> who lodged on the other ſide of that wall, and the confidence that the Lady had to lie ſtill in that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, rendered his ſuſpicions evident. The Husband ſhewed him then one day the fatal place; and the Stanza maker perceiving the falſe Window, puſhed the board with great force, which opened a little and diſcovered the half of the Artifice; Behold, Sir, ſaid the Abbot then to the old man, there is the hole by which you are abuſed, and through which may come the Souls of ſome of the Children that Madam your Lady may bear to you, but your Brothers Ghoſt never came this way. At theſe words the poor confuſed Husband was in a great conſternation, but however he ſlighted not that good hint, and reſolved to be cleared in the matter to the full: To his Wifes great misfortune who was now come to the time of receiving ſome chaſtiſement for the abuſe ſhe had put upon her Husband; for that happens ſoon or late, Ladies, and as a good Chriſtian I give this admonition.</p>
               <p>How? ſaid <hi>Madam de Moulionne,</hi> muſt we have the moral of it alſo? It is becauſe he has a mind to marry, added <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> that he begins to concern himſelf in the common intereſt. I believe it, for my part, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers</hi> laughing;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100358:144"/>but his reſolution muſt needs be very ſudden; for it is not three days ago ſince he was of another mind, and was himſelf a man that would have given thoſe that would have hearken'd to him, very contrary counſel, Never mind that, anſwered he, for though I love theſe Gallantries, yet I think they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be puniſhed. It is not an hour ago ſince I told you, that I would not ſo much as keep ſuch Womens ſecrets. So, very well: ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> I am glad I know your humour, at leaſt I ſhall not run the risk of doing you a kindneſs; However make an end of your tale. Ah! My Soul, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, it is a true Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>After the Abbot then had put that jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie into the Husbands head; the Ladies ill luck would ſo have it, that he found at his feet a Note written to her by <hi>Commorgien</hi> in theſe terms.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

               </floatingText>
               <p>That was the laſt Note that he wrote to her, on occaſion that ſhe had prayed him, by her Chamber-Maid, not to venture any more to come through the hole; and which had been careleſly pulled out as ſhe was ordering ſomewhat in her Trunk. But Sir, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> again interrupting him, you have a great ſympathie with the friends of Romances, in that you know ſo well (like them) all the Letters that your <hi>Hero</hi> wrote. Madam, anſwered <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> you ſhould not be ſurpriſed at that; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Chevalier was ſo obliging as to compoſe them for my Coſin, for that is not <hi>Commorgiens</hi> ſtile. I confeſs it, replied <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> he prayed me to do him that favour, and I did it. In the mean time the reading of that Note did not a little contribute to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the poor Husbands puzle, who perceived the ornament of his head inſenſibly appear in publick. But in a word, whatever came of it, he reſolved to revenge himſelf if he could. He made no doubt but that the Spirit would impudently return to affront thoſe that intended to conjure it, if he made ſome godly people once more lie in the Chamber. Beſides them he reſolved to hide
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100358:145"/>there two ſturdy Rogues to apprehend the Gallant when he appeared. And your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins luck was at that time good, <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi> that one of theſe Rogues was a Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been heretofore a Souldier in his Regiment. Had it not been for that, he had met with ſevere dealings. But the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowing him, cried out, that he was a perſon of Quality, oppoſed himſelf to the fury of the Husband, who came with a Piſtol in his hand to kill him; made way for the Spirit with thumping blows through a crowd of people that came running to the noiſe, and gave <hi>Commorgien</hi> time to ſecure himſelf in a Lodging: he ſlipt into the next Houſe, from whence he immediately acquainted his friends with his diſaſter. And what did the Lady do? ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing but death, anſwered the Chevalier; and all her hopes were in thoſe that were preſent at the ſhow, who might hinder her Husband from uſing the utmoſt extremities againſt her. He dragged her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber where the adventure had happened; and having demanded the Key of her Trunk before all the Company, he took an Inventory of all her Letters and Notes which he read aloud; And this amongſt the reſt, which was but the ſlubbered draught of a Letter that ſhe had written to <hi>Commorgien.</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:100358:146"/>If my memory fail me not, it was conceived in theſe very terms; for the Husband gave it me to read.</p>

                        <hi>My dear Girl, I heartily regret that you are in the place where you are. You have leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty there than you had with your Husband; but take comfort. I have had Letters from</hi> Lions <hi>which inform me that the Ghoſt of his deceaſed Brother has appeared to him again,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100358:148"/>by the care that a Gentleman one of my friends hath taken about that matter; and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition will retard his return more than three weeks. So that with the aſſiſtance of ſome other ſtratagem to get you civilly out of the clutches of your Dragon; you may go and bring into the world a little</hi> Commorgien <hi>in any place you pleaſe. In the mean while I am preparing all things for your departure, and I ſhall ſtay for you privately two Leagues from hence, that I may carry you to the place that we ſhall chuſe. Farewel. Seem much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to morrow when you receive the Letter you know.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>There was leſs Gallantry in this than in any other of the Letters; but it was this note that beſt declared the poor Husbands deſtiny. Ah! impudent Slut, cried he, caſting all the Papers he had in his hands at his Wifes face; I ſhall be revenged for the affront you have done me. He went immediately out of doors, and left her in the greateſt confuſion imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and for four or five hours no body could tell what was become of him. In the mean while ſhe reſolved not to ſtay till his return, but conſulted how to put her ſelf in ſecurity, well foreſeeing, that his rage would not ſtop there. She prayed me to wait upon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100358:148"/>her to a Nunnery, where ſhe ſtayed ſome days before her Husband was yet come home. He was gone to <hi>Paris:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I took my Journey for <hi>Holland,</hi> and I know not as yet how he hath revenged himſelf.</p>
               <p>Is that all? ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Yes, Madam, anſwered he, and I think it is enough to prove, as I promiſed, that no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits appear now adays, unleſs it be to make Husbands Cuckolds. Hark ye, ſaid <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> to the Company, I will not pretend to be an undaunted Wit like the Chevalier; but it is true, that the Spirits of this World play pleaſant pranks, if nothing can awaken thoſe of the other. For ſince the trick that hath been put upon the Preſident <hi>D'ardivilliers,</hi> by ſome who intended to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his Houſe without paying rent; it is not to be doubted but that there is a great cheat in all the Apparitions which are many times told us for true. Courage! <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Chevalier, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> you are now ſeconded by <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſieux.</hi> She is juſt about to tell us another tale for the juſtification of yours. Ah! Madam, anſwered <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> take not this, if you pleaſe, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented tale. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Preſident <hi>D'ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divilliers</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:100358:149"/>is ſtill alive; and ſeeing your Husband and he meet often together, you may get your Husband to ask him if what I ſay be not true. But however that you may learn the circumſtances of the ſtory, I'll tell you what I know of it.</p>

               <head>NOVEL XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF THE Spirit of <hi>Ardivilliers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARdivilliers</hi> is a very pleaſant ſeat in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Brete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil.</hi> It was haunted by a ſpirit, and that Maſter Goblin made a fearful noiſe there. All the night long the Houſe appeared to be in a flame; and hideous howlings were heard from thence; which happened only at certain times of the year, about <hi>All hallow</hi> tide. No body durſt live there but the Farmer who had got acquaintance of the Spirit. If any one in paſſing came to lie there, he was foundly drubbed, and bore the marks on his skin at leaſt ſix months after. If it chanced to be a buxom woman, the Spirit was ſatisfied to do no more but draw the Curtains, and lay its ſpiritual hands on what part it pleaſed.</p>
               <p>By my truth that is good, ſaid the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100358:150"/>that was a witty Spirit indeed.</p>
               <p>Next day, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> the fair one wou'd ſay, that ſhe had felt ſomething cold ſteal down by her ſide; and ſhe had account given her what it was. And ſo much for the Houſe. The Countrey people about ſaw a great many things more; for now and then ſome body ſaw at a diſtance a dozen of other Spirits in the Air hovering over the Houſe. They were all of fire, ye muſt know, and danced a Country dance. Another ſaw in a Meadow I know not how many Preſidents and Counſellors in red Gowns; but without doubt all likewiſe of fire. In ſuch a place they ſat and condemned to Death a Gentleman of that Country who had his head ſtruck off at leaſt a hundred years ago. Another met in the night a Gentleman the Preſidents Kinſman. He was walking with the Wife of another Gentleman that lived hard by. They told the Ladies name: and obſerve, if you pleaſe, that the Kinſman and Lady are both ſtill alive. They added, that ſhe ſuffered him to court her, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward both ſhe and her Gallant diſappeared. So that a great many others ſaw or at leaſt heard of the wonders of the Houſe of <hi>Ardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiers.</hi> This Farce laſted above five or ſix years, and did the Preſident much prejudice, who was forced to let his land to the tenant
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100358:150"/>at a very low rate. But at length he reſolved to put a ſtop to theſe Apparitions being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by many circumſtances, that ſome body had a cunning hand in all that. About All-hallow-tide he went to his Eſtate, lay in the Houſe, and made two Gentlemen of his friends ſtay by him in the Chamber, who were fully reſolved at the firſt noiſe or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, to fire their Piſtols at the Spirits. The Spirits who knew all things, in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance knew of theſe preparations: and none of them appeared. They ſtood in awe of the Preſidents Spirit which they knew was more ſubtle and ſtronger than themſelves. They contented themſelves only to trail Chains in a Chamber over the Preſidents head, at which noiſe the Wife and Children of the Farmer came running to their Maſters aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They caſt themſelves at his knees that they might hinder him from going up into that Chamber. Oh! my Lord, cried they, expoſe not your ſelf to the danger. What is the ſtrength of man, againſt the Spirits of the other World? <hi>Monſieur de Fecaucour</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the ſame thing before you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a disjointed arm. <hi>Monſieur de Vurſailles</hi> alſo reſolved to play the Bravo: and was almoſt ſmothered under bundles of Hay, and fell next day dangerouſly ſick upon it. In fine, they alledged ſo many ſuch like
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100358:151"/>inſtances to the Preſident, that his friends would not ſuffer him to expoſe himſelf to what the Spirit might do in its own defence; they took the Commiſſion upon themſelves alone: and ſo both went up to that great and vaſt Chamber where the noiſe was made, with a Piſtol in one hand, and a Candle in the other. At firſt they ſaw nothing but a thick ſmoke which was redoubled by ſome flames that by intervals aſcended. They ſtayed a little till the ſmoke cleared up, and in the mean time had a confuſed ſight of the Spirit in the middle of it. It ſeemed to be a great Monſter making Gamboles, but was preſently again by another mixture of flame and ſmoke eclipſed from their ſight; it had Horns and a long tail; and was in a word a hideous and terrible object. At that ſight one of the two Gentlemen felt his courage ſhrink a little. There is ſomething ſupernatural in this, ſaid he to the other, come let us withdraw; but the other that was bolder ſtood his ground. No, no; anſwered he, that ſmoke ſtinks of Gun-powder, and it is nothing extraordinary. Yea the Spirit it ſelf is but half Maſter of its Trade, ſeeing it hath not as yet blown out our Candles. With that he advanced, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Ghoſt; choſe a convenient place where to ſhoot, fired his Piſtol and hit his mark; but was all amazed when the Spirit
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100358:151"/>inſtead of falling, turned again and ſtood firm before him. Then he began himſelf to be a little afraid. However he took heart again, being perſwaded that it could not be a Spirit. And perceiving that the Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin durſt not ſtay for him, and ſhunned to let him lay his hands upon it; he reſolved to eatch it to ſee if it might be felt, or if it would melt away and vaniſh in his hands. The Spirit finding himſelf too much preſſed upon, leaves the Chamber and went down a little pair of ſtairs in a Corner. The Gentleman follows it down, loſes no ſight of it, croſſes over Courts and Gardens, and fetched as many compaſſes as the Ghoſt did; until that at length it came to a Barn which it found open, skipped in, and finding it ſelf ſhut in, choſe rather to diſappear than to be taken. And ſo ſunk down againſt a wall where the Gentleman thought to have ſtopped it; which left him in a ſtrange confuſion.</p>
               <p>I believed it, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> and he had reaſon to be ſo. And is it by this you have told us, that you pretend to prove that there is cunning and cheating in appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Yes, Madam, anſwered <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and that Spirit was no other than the Preſidents own tenant. I was going to ſay ſo, added <hi>Montal,</hi> and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your ſtory I ſuſpected it. And
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100358:152"/>for my part, replied <hi>Madam de Moulionne,</hi> I had no ſuch thought, nor do I believe it yet. You have told us nothing which a man can do, at leaſt if he were not a Magician. No, Madam, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> he was no Magician, and yet did all that I have told you. But, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> you jeaſt; for beſides that he diſappeared all of a ſudden, how can you perſwade me that it is in the power of a man to make a Houſe ſeem all on fire, if he were not a Sorcerer? He made trains of powder on the roof of the Houſe, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and at the times appointed for the mummery, put fire to them, which appeared at a great diſtance in the night time. He had alſo one of thoſe Clubs which the <hi>Zani</hi> uſe on the ſtage; with that he ratled upon the tiles, which made ſuch a clattering, as one would have ſaid that all the roof was tumbling down in pieces. Good reaſons indeed, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne!</hi> How comes it then that he alſo made dozens of Spirits appear in the air over the Houſe? It was not he, Madam, anſwered the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, that made thoſe appear, nor yet the Judges in red Gowns, and the Preſidents Kinſman; it was the roguery of ſome Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who took pleaſure to raiſe that report. Is it not uſual that men never ſpeak of ſuch
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100358:152"/>like things, without adding immediately a thouſand tales enough to make one ſleep ſtanding. If I may lawfully tell my thoughts on the Apparition of the Kinſman; becauſe both he and the Lady are ſtill alive; it might have been true that he was really ſeen with her, and the Spirit needed not to have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed their ſhapes. It is no impoſſible thing for a man of <hi>Paris</hi> who is handſom and witty, to make a fool of a Country Gentleman of <hi>Picardie.</hi> But they vaniſhed, replied ſhe. Well, well! continued <hi>Montal,</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lay down upon the graſs, and ſo the men loſt ſight of them. Have I not illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the caſe very well? ſaid he to <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Barbiſieux.</hi> I can ſay nothing as to that, anſwered ſhe; but it is certain, that that ſame knaviſh Farmer was the only cauſe of all the diſorder; and to anſwer the great objection which Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> has made to me upon the Spirits ſinking down againſt the wall when the Preſidents friend thought to have catcht him; I need do no more but make an end of my ſtory.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman having ſeen him ſink down in that manner, called in ſome people: cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an inſtrument to be brought whereby he might ſound into the place where the Ghoſt ſeemed to vaniſh; and found there was a trap door there, which ſhut with a bolt when one
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100358:153"/>was in. He went down, and found the Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin provided with good mattreſſes, whereon he fell ſo ſoft, that if he had thrown himſelf down headlong it would not have hurt him. He made him come forth, and there found that the charm which made the Spirit Piſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; was a skin of buff fitted to all the parts of his body. The Gallant confeſſed all his tricks, and was quitted for paying to his Maſter the Arrears of five years, after the rate that the Land was let at before the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A more vindicative and leſs virtuous man than the Preſident would have cauſed him to have been hang'd. This, Madam, I aſſure you is true, and without doubt we ſhould not believe all that is ſaid of Spirits and Apparitions after ſuch a cheat as this.</p>
               <p>I believe whatever you pleaſe, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> but for all that, I ſhall ever be ſtrangely afraid of them, and the very thought hath brought tears already into my eyes. I very well believe you, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> for that never fails to happen to my ſelf who am none of the moſt timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, when they ſpeak to me of Spirits. I take my ſelf to be a little ſtouter than you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid <hi>Montal,</hi> and yet I cannot reſiſt (no more than any other) the firſt impreſſions that ſuch idle notions give us; and it is not to be thought ſtrange. Man has not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100358:153"/>enough over himſelf to change eaſily a habit that he hath had from a Child, of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the naming of Ghoſts, and in ſpight of reaſon, the ſole imagination of a terrible object is able to make the moſt reſolute ſhake. Yet for all that, I ſhould not forbear to keep my way in any darkſom place whatſoever, if my buſineſs called me that way; neither ſhould I forbear to follow any thing that might appear to me, though it were with trembling, that ſo I might be ſatisfied in the reality of what it appears. I doubt much of that laſt point, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers.</hi> And ſo do I, added Madam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> This Diſcourſe was interrupted by the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Lacquey, who brought a Letter to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is a pleaſant Letter, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> to her; your eyes were very merry as you read it. I confeſs it is, anſwered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> and yet it ought to grieve me; for the ſubject of it is neither more nor leſs than the death of one who is nearly related to a perſon whom I eſteem. Ah! <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> cried the Chevalier, I gueſs what the matter is: and if you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth, you wiſh already the party were dead. Why ſo? anſwered ſhe very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, I wiſh no bodies death. The manner of your anſwer, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> makes
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100358:154"/>me alſo begin to gueſs at ſome thing. If that perſon ſhould die, would not you be revenged of that Bigot of whom you promiſed us the Hiſtory? I know not, Madam, anſwered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> if you know what Bigot I intended to ſpeak of: however you may not be much miſtaken. In fine then, ſaid the Chevalier, the good man the Marqueſs of <hi>Iſoura</hi> will be quickly dead! praiſed be God, added he, that makes way for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Romance; one of our Heroins will be ſuddenly married. He made <hi>Made-moiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> bluſh, when he named that good old Marqueſs. In truth you are not ſo wiſe as you think, ſaid ſhe to him: you think that you are well acquainted with my affairs, and in the mean time are wholly ignorant of them. With all my ignorance, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle,</hi> anſwered he, I wiſh the good man were in his Grave; and we had heard the Hiſtory of the Bigot; for now is the time to tell it, and that Letter is come too oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to put you upon that diſcourſe, for us now to loſe the occaſion of hearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of your Adventures. I refuſe not to perform what I promiſed, replied ſhe: but he that brought me the Letter ſtays for an anſwer, and I beg the Companies leave to go write it. With theſe words ſhe withdrew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a private Chamber, whither ſhe carried the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100358:154"/>Lacquey; and the other Ladies went down with <hi>Montal</hi> into the Garden to fetch a walk, whilſt ſhe wrote her Letter.</p>
               <p>When they were at the end of the Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot, they perceived without in an Alley, Company that were come alſo to walk there. Amongſt others <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers</hi> knew the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> with little <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny.</hi> There is a man, ſaid ſhe immediately to Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> ſhewing her the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain;</hi> of whom one might tell a pretty romanting ſtory. What ſtory? anſwered <hi>Montal.</hi> Let us not go their way, replied ſhe, leſt he come and hinder me from ſpeaking of it; for it is a ſecret that he hath imparted to me, and prayed me not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge. They turned aſide as ſhe deſired, to hear it, and thus ſhe began.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF The Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> and a fair Princeſs.</head>
               <p>THat Gentleman who was ſomewhat of Kin to a young Soveraign Lady in our Neighbourhood, paſſed one day through her Territories. You ſee that he is handſome and well made. He made Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Princeſs, and was not diſliked by her. The eſteem ſhe had for him became ſo great, that to prevent falling into ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſhe was conſtrained to ſend him back into his own Country. Any other but I might have a fair occaſion here to ſpeak of the tears ſhe ſhed before ſhe could bring her ſelf to that reſolution, and of the conflict that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between her Virtue and Love; but that I leave to ſome <hi>Mademoiſelle de Scudery,</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:100358:155"/>or to the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> himſelf; for my part, I underſtand nothing of that. He returned then into <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt as much afflicted to be ſeparated from the Princeſs, as ſhe was to part from him. They wrote to one another: fell both ſick, and too much Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue made them languiſh and pine away with Love. In this interval the Soveraign Prince died; and the Marqueſs believed his fortune might be bettered by that. The Lady ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined alſo that ſhe ſhould not any longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch hard ſufferings, and that ſhe might at leaſt purſue her deſires without a crime. But a Monſter more terrible than Virtue came to meddle in her affairs.</p>
               <p>Conſider a little, ſaid Madam <hi>de Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> how that Lady tells her ſtory, and ſpeaks of virtue in a jocoſe way! it ſeems that ſhe really ſcorns it. And ſo ſhe has reaſon to do, ſaid the Chevalier, it is the ſimpleſt thing in the World; eſpecially for a Maid, added he looking on her. At leaſt reply'd ſhe laughing, you never let ſlip an occaſion to put me out of conceit with it, and I know not what I ought to think of it. Whatever you pleaſe, anſwered he between his teeth, and with a kind of fooliſh tranſport: I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h indeed for my own repoſe that you had leſs of it.</p>
               <p>A Monſter then, more cruel than virt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100358:156"/>continued the fair Hollander, came to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over the Princeſs. Inſtead of conſenting that the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> ſhould return into the Low-Countreys, ſhe diſcharged him abſolutely ever to think of it. She was afraid to do ſomewhat unbeſeeming her quality, if ſhe ſhould take a conceit to marry him. She permitted him not ſo much as to write to her. The poor man languiſhed in ſorrow, but at length love inſpir'd into him a deſign worthy of one of its Hero's. He underſtood Painting a little, and from his infancie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination led him to learn as much of the art as was ſutable to a Gentleman of his quality. He diſguiſed himſelf, provided himſelf with the Pictures of moſt of the great Lords of the Court of <hi>France;</hi> forgot not his own; went with his Commodities, to the Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Town; ſet up Shop over againſt her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and there expoſed to view all his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures except his own, for ſome reaſons that he had. He was willing that the Princeſs ſhould find it there by ſurpriſe, that ſo he might judge of her ſentiments if by chance ſhe ſhould have the curioſitie to come ſee his Pictures. He made a preſent of a piece to one of the Maids of honour belonging to the Princeſs, and obtained a promiſe from her that ſhe would perſwade her Lady to take that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie. The Princeſs came one day to his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100358:156"/>Houſe, and deſiring to ſee the Pictures of ſome of the Nobility of the French Court, he made his own appear as if it had been by chance and undeſigned, whilſt he was looking for others. The Princeſs at that ſurprizing ſight, changed colour, bluſht, looked pale, and in fine fainted away; a Princeſs of <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> or <hi>Cirus</hi> could not have done more; her Attendants ſought ſome pretext for her faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and brought her back to her Palace. She never opened her eyes but to weep, nor her mouth but to fetch grievous ſighs. <hi>Alas!</hi> cried ſhe, <hi>dear cauſe of all my grief, by what ill luck are you come to give me that pitileſs idea which is the ground of all the evils I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;</hi> adding to that many more ſuch like la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations.</p>
               <p>If the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> heard in what ſtrain ſhe tells his ſtory, ſaid Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne,</hi> he would wiſh her dead. O! have a ſpecial care, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> not to ſpeak a word of it to him. I tell it in his own words; and only endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him. That would be maliciouſly done, ſaid <hi>Montal;</hi> but he will meet us, when we come to the end of this Alley, and I ſhall give him notice of it. Ha! replied the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, you will then make him my Enemy, and I ſhould be vexed if he came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that I laugh at the relation which he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100358:157"/>made to me of his adventures. Well, the Princeſs then never opened her lips but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſhortly after ſent for the Painter; for ſhe had a mind to buy the fatal Picture. But what became of her at the ſight of the Painter himſelf, when he had put off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and fell down at her knees? This might afford matter for a great tome, yet I will not ſpeak a word of it. The preſence of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at length ſtifled all conſiderations of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and virtue; ſhe abandoned her ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her dear Marqueſs; with only this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, to grant him nothing but what was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A Conſcientious Marriage did the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>Good God! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting her; what are theſe conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marriages then? He! replied the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, that is a civil piece of Gallantry: But is that Good? replied ſhe. Why, Madam, anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> do you doubt of it? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reliſhes better; it is a mixture of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and looſeneſs, which is altogether deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. You jeaſt, ſaid ſhe, and one cannot tell what to make of that you ſay; but anſwer me ſeriouſly. Think you that the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Marriage of Madam the Counteſs of <hi>Vilagrand,</hi> with the Gentleman of her Horſe; That of Madam the Princeſs of <hi>Norias,</hi> with her Neighbour; that of the Dutcheſs of .....
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100358:157"/>I have forgot her name, with her Steward, and of a great many others: do you indeed believe them to be pleaſing to God? Yes, Madam, replied he, and they would not be permitted if the matter were otherwayes. You name the Princeſs of <hi>Norias,</hi> ſaid <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle Velzers,</hi> interrupting them; but ſhe is not married, that is but a calumnie. <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle,</hi> anſwered <hi>Montal,</hi> you come too late to diſpute the truth of it, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain, nor more univerſally talk'd of. Let it be ſo, Sir, replied <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Velzers,</hi> it is but a tale then univerſally talk'd of. The Princeſs of <hi>Norias</hi> is not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and perhaps before it be long, you will ſee her falſifie all theſe reports, by marrying a greater Prince than her former Husband; for the Stars appoint her for that. But from whence proceeds then the concern that her neighbour takes in all her affairs? ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne.</hi> Have you never had any that concerned himſelf in yours, Madam? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Hollander. But beſides, that one may have a concern for her by reaſon of her merit and wit; for ſhe has a great deal, and can pleaſe whom ſhe will; there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reaſon that engages her neighbour to it. He was the friend of the late Prince; and that good old man upon his Death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him the intereſts of his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100358:158"/>and made him ſwear never to forſake them: this may be eaſily believed, if one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on the one hand the ſolid ſupport of ſuch a man as he, and on the other hand, the affairs that the Lady might meet with. She had no Children, and ſeveral Heirs believed her the occaſion of ſome injuſtice that was done them. It is a thought, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> not eaſily to be put out of their heads. And nevertheleſs, replied <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Velzers,</hi> there was never any more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; for one might rather ſay, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Family would have been utterly undone, had it not been for the advantage the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs brought to it. You are one of her friends ſaid the Chevalier to <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers:</hi> and it may be eaſily perceived that you are much obliged to her. How I? anſwered ſhe, not in the leaſt; it is not for any obligation that I have to her; nor can I ſo much as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſhe knows all the good I ſpeak of her; but I love to give teſtimony to the truth. We have made a pretty long digreſſion, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> and it hath hindered you to make an end of your ſtory. What, did it not end by the marriage? replied <hi>Montal,</hi> that would be againſt the rules of a Romance. Not ſo, ſaid the fair Hollander, a Marriage of Conſcience cannot ſerve for a good concluſion.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:100358:158"/>
               <p>They were married then, continued ſhe, ſo as I have ſaid; and had two Children. After that, the Lady had a mind to come ſee her Husbands Father under the pretext of ſome other buſineſs that ſhe had to do in <hi>France.</hi> When ſhe arrived at his Houſe, the good Man asked his Son, where they might moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably lay the Princeſs. The Son anſwered, that ſhe ſhould lie with him. The Father who knew nothing of the Marriage was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the reply which he thought was too free; and gave the Marqueſs a Box on the Ear: (all theſe circumſtances belong to the ſtory.) The Princeſs to hinder him from giving him a ſecond, told him, that his Son might lie with her, and the reaſon why; which filled him with a joy proportionable to the honour he received. Three or four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Princeſs died; and the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> was by her Heirs, ſent back to <hi>France.</hi> His two Children were poiſoned: and that is the concluſion of his adventures; let us now go meet him when you pleaſe; he has perhaps ſome other later ſtory to tell us.</p>
               <p>Preſently after they came to the end of the Alley, and entered into another, where the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> was walking with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny,</hi> they joined all together and continued their walk. Gentlemen, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> by what happy adventure is it that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100358:159"/>we meet you here to day? A Fool has brought us hither, anſwered the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain;</hi> and we accompanied him to ſee a Spirit, which, as he ſays, walks in theſe Alleys. Ho, ho! Gentlemen, replied ſhe, is the rumour of that Apparition then come to your Ears? is he then to whom that Spirit hath appeared, a Courtier? Without doubt, replied he; for it is the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel.</hi> How? is it he, ſaid ſhe, and was he ſo near us the other day? At this preſent, replied he, he is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below, and very deſirous that the Spirit might appear to him once more: we left him there all alone. How? ſaid Madam <hi>de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionne,</hi> would he ſee the Spirit again? I was told that when he ſaw it before, he fainted away for fear. It was not for fear, Madam, anſwered little <hi>Luſigny,</hi> it was for joy and love; for you may pleaſe to know, the Spirit was the Ghoſt of his deceaſed Miſtreſs. But really, Madam, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> at theſe words; <hi>Vaux</hi> is a rare place for adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and I fancie that the ſoil of its Park has ſome ſecret virtue to produce them. They continued for ſome time in this diſcourſe, and then fell to ſpeak of other matters; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> who had written her Letter coming at a diſtance, they went all to meet her; except <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> whom <hi>Mademoiſelle de Kermas,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100358:159"/>to draw aſide to the place where the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel</hi> was left, to the end, ſaid ſhe, that we may ſurpriſe him and put him in a fright. How? anſwered the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Lady, can you then reſolve at length to ſhew ſome trick, you who can hear whole ſtories and never ſpeak a word? And what would you have me ſay, replied the lovely <hi>Breton?</hi> is it not enough that I hear you all? and that I am pleaſed with your ſtories? With that ſhe preſſed her again to go to the place where the Marqueſs was; the reaſon is becauſe I know him as well as you do, added ſhe, and we ſhall be pleaſed, if we can engage him to tell the ſtory of his deceaſed Miſtreſs, who hath appeared to him. With all my heart, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> but what if it come whilſt we are with him? what a Fool are you! replied <hi>Kermas;</hi> are you ſo weak as to believe ſuch fopperies? How! cried <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> you are one of our undaunted wits then? Ah! really, continued ſhe, I wonder at it no more that your grave and ſevere women are ſaid to be the more dangerous, that they pretend to ſo little. You muſt needs be a good ſoul, ſince you are not afraid of Spirits. They advanced ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel.</hi> The fair <hi>Breton</hi> had on a mask, and that ſhe might not at all be diſcovered, ſhe prayed her
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100358:160"/>friend not to name her, and more particularly not to engage her to ſpeak. Her reaſon was, that they would obtain more ſatisfaction from the Marqueſs, if he ſhould not know who ſhe was. There muſt be ſome great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie in that, replied <hi>Velzers;</hi> but it's all one, let's go on. Afterward they joined the poor Lover, whom their preſence put out of a great fit of muſing.</p>
               <p>He was ſitting on a little bench by the ſide of the Pales, ſtill expecting the return of the dear Ghoſt of a perſon whom he adored whilſt ſhe lived. We come to diſturb your ſolitude, cried <hi>Maidemoiſelle Velzers</hi> to him at a pretty diſtance. We interrupt the ſweet entertainment that perhaps you enjoy here with your own thoughts; but you muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that indiſcretion, and impute it only to the curioſitie that we have to ſee rarities. A Lover who loves a woman even after ſhe is dead, ſeems in our opinion ſo extraordinary a thing, that we could not forbear to come and admire you. He roſe and ſaluted <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle Velzers,</hi> taking no more notice of the other than he thought ſhe deſired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had not pulled off her mask; and anſwering the lovely Hollander with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſmile: I well deſerve to be jeared by the fair ones for my extravagance, ſaid he, but Madam, that fancy muſt have its time. Never
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100358:160"/>was man or woman who at leaſt once in their lives have not been in love. To think we jear you, becauſe you are a civil Gentleman, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> is to interpret ill the reaſon of our coming. However, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, is it not to put us in fear that you have ſpread the report of that Apparition knowing that we were here? for to be ſhort, we believe it not to be true. Ah! ſaid he, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> I am ready to take any oath imaginable, that there can be nothing truer. I was in this ſame place on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my <hi>Valet de chambre,</hi> whom I had ſent to a place a quarter of a League off, to learn if a friend of mine was there, before I went thither my ſelf. And as I caſt my eyes without minding any thing, into that little Arbour which you ſee there below; I ſaw the Ghoſt come out of the ground, ſtand up on its legs, and then vaniſh. The ſight ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed me, that my <hi>Valet de chambre,</hi> at his return, found me almoſt without life or ſenſe. He was forced to run into the Houſe and call for help.</p>
               <p>We have a Gentleman with us, ſaid <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle Velzers,</hi> not unknown to you, it is the Chevalier <hi>de Montal;</hi> I wiſh he heard you averr what you ſaw to be true; for it cannot be beat into his brains, that any ſuch thing is poſſible: withal, added ſhe, we come to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100358:161"/>take you out of this place which is too Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick for you. Beſides I am a little too fearful to abide here any longer. You muſt go to another place, and muſt tell us the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of theſe fair amours which death it ſelf cannot cool. Ah! <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> cried he ſmiling as he had done before; do not engage me to that. We will never leave you till you do it, replied ſhe, and it is but loſt labour to refuſe. That is a trick continued he, put upon me by <hi>Mireſtain</hi> and <hi>Luſigny;</hi> they have ſent you hither to jear me at this rate. Why to jear you? anſwered ſhe. It is not jearing to pray people to tell their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. At theſe words they withdrew from the Arbour, and as they walked, he ſaid to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle Velzers.</hi>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF THE Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough you be of the number of my friends, you are nevertheleſs as ſevere to me as others, and to tell an indifferent perſon, ſuch as you are, that one has been deeply in love, is to give a fair occaſion of diverſion. It's no matter, added he, it was my luck to have been ſo before I married Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Kimperbel;</hi> and though I be married, and have all the eſteem and complacency for my Wife ſhe can deſire; yet ſtill I love her memory whom I adored before I became her Husband; my heart feels ſtill a perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for her death; and my paſſion is ſo great, that I had rather ſee often the Ghoſt that you have been told appeared to me, than the moſt delightful objects in the world. With theſe words tears came in his eyes, which in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100358:162"/>ſpight of the endeavours he uſed to repreſs them, were perceived by the Lady; who told him laughing, I take no notice, Sir, weep boldly. Ah! jearing Lady, anſwered he, you have already your hearts deſire, and nothing is now wanting to your mirth, and ſo went on. That poor Maid was called, <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Kermas,</hi> of one of the moſt illuſtrious Families in <hi>Brettanie;</hi> but ruined by time and fortune. I grew acquainted with her by means of her Brothers, with whom I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome kind of friendſhip in an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where we learnt our exerciſes. I fell all of a ſudden, almoſt as paſſionately in love with her, as I continued to be for the future. And it was no wonder, for ſhe was indeed very lovely; a brown Complexion, of a moſt exquiſite ſhape: her eyes filled with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſweetneſs beyond compare; her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures delicate, her neck divine; and as witty as ever was Lady; but a little more inclining to ſeriouſneſs than mirth.</p>
               <p>When he had ſo ſaid, <hi>Mademoiſelle Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> turned to the lovely Breton, whom ſhe had ſeveral times already jog'd with her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, as <hi>Monſieur de Kimperbel</hi> ſpake. What ſtrange adventure is this then? ſaid ſhe whiſpering her in the ear. I hear both your name and deſcription, and it ſeems he deſigns you by his diſcourſe; but you are ſtill alive.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100358:162"/>
                  <hi>Kermas</hi> made her no anſwer, but by jogging her likewiſe, that ſhe might give her a ſign not to interrupt the Marqueſs. Theſe little geſtures, Ladies, ſaid he, make me ſuſpect that ye have a deſign in making me relate my ſtory; perhaps I know that masked Lady; but however I am reſolved to divert you.</p>
               <p>I fell then extreamly in love at firſt ſight, and uſed all imaginable wayes to make her ſenſible of it. I was even ſo happy as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her not to hate me, and after a months conflict to bring her to conſent to marry me privately. Having taken our meaſures, we were married in preſence of her two Brothers, and three or four other Conſidents. We lived together three months after, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tranquillity and content; without the leaſt croſs or ſuſpicion. I conveyed my ſelf ſecretly out of doors every night by a back Gate of the Garden where the Brothers of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Kermas</hi> ſtayed for me, guarded me to their Siſters Lodgings, and brought me back again before day; theſe were amiable difficulties which did no injury to our love. But our ſecret was at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; for my Father being Governour of the Town, and it being very difficult to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond our ſelves in a place where every body knew us, and we not every body; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all my circumſpection, without doubt
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100358:163"/>ſome body obſerved my night walks. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be whiſpered about that I was in love; and that I went every night to try my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The rumour of this came to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ears, and he ſet a watch over me; yet in the beginning, more out of curioſity to learn who was his Sons Miſtreſs, than for any other reaſon; he was not ſo nice as ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are; and would have willingly allowed me a little Gallantry. However, I ordered my affairs ſo well, that I diſappointed all his Spies. He diſcovered nothing by my intrigue, but that I was fit to be married ſince I had a Miſtreſs; and upon that account he plied me ſome days after. He deſigned me from my Childhood for Madam <hi>de Kimperbel,</hi> and I had long expected that ſtorm. But could not ſee it ſo ready to break out without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible apprehenſions. I trembled at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition my Father made to me of marrying Madam <hi>de Kimperbel.</hi> Sir, anſwered I, what would you have me do with a Child? ſhe that you would give me for a Wife is but ten years of age, and I my ſelf but fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; are we at that age capable of love? You are fit to love, replied he, ſince you are able to reaſon ſo well about it, and beſides the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>de Kimarez,</hi> whom I deſign for you, is not only the richeſt match in the Country, but within a year or two will be alſo one of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100358:163"/>greateſt beauties in <hi>France.</hi> All that is true, Sir, anſwered I, but notwithſtanding thereof, I know not if I can love her ſo much as you would. And why not? replied he; ye have been bred together from the Cradle, and have loved one another well enough hitherto. Yes, ſaid I immediately; but the love that I had for her is changed into a fraternal kindneſs. In ſuch a caſe conjugal love is looked upon as a kind of inceſt; and to change from the one to the other, though it be lawful and conſonant to order, yet is almoſt impoſſible to nature.</p>
               <p>You laugh, ſaid he, interrupting himſelf, becauſe I tell you all, even the diſcourſes that I had with my Father. On the contrary, ſaid ſhe, it is becauſe I love to hear them; and the truth is, for a ſtripling of fifteen, you were very knowing. I run out inſenſibly, ſaid he, and inlarge in a relation that I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make ſhort, but I cannot help it, what is paſt is always preſent to me, and pleaſes me ſtill. But however, think it was I then, or I now, that was ſo knowing, it is all one for the ſtory, and indifferent to me. My Father, who, from one of my age at leaſt, expected not to hear what I ſaid to him, perceived very well that I had ſome ſecret counſel, and feared that my hidden loves might prove dangerous. He reſolved to watch me more
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100358:164"/>than ever. He pretended that he would not force me to marry my Wife; that ſo remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from me all occaſion of miſtruſt, I might be the ſooner catch'd in what he imagined touched me cloſeſt. But he would have loſt his labour, had not I ſome days after fallen into a violent Feaver. I had over-heated my ſelf at hunting, and fell light-headed in that Feaver. In the hight of my fits I called often on my dear <hi>Kermas;</hi> and that was enough to diſcover all to my Father. Seeing he was an ambitious man and had no Sons but my ſelf; he was mad, and out of all patience when he came to know of my marriage: and his rage produced the moſt cruel effects that can be imagined; which I wave, becauſe the ſtory would thereby prove too long. O! Sir, that's no matter, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers,</hi> tell us all the circumſtances, I pray you; for I aſſure you, I am ſo much concerned at what you ſay, that it makes me melt; and produces perhaps in the heart of the masked Lady here better ſentiments for you. Whilſt ſhe was ſpeaking ſo to the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel, Kermas</hi> tug'd with all her force her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the Gown, for fear ſhe might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her; I am much obliged to her, anſwered he, whoſoever ſhe be; but I ſhall not have time enough to do what you deſire; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the reflexion on that ſubject would too
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100358:164"/>ſenſibly affect me. It is enough that I tell you, that after my Fathers patience had been tired out by the reſiſtance of that poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he urged to conſent to the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of her marriage, he cauſed her to be ſecretly carried away, and ſhut her up in a Caſtle ſurrounded by the Sea, whereof one of his friends was Governour. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt undone the two Gentlemen her Brothers alſo; and that misfortune had very near coſt me my life. It behoved me though to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the exceſs of my diſcontent, for fear that if my Father had loſt all hopes of ſeeing me forget <hi>Mademoiſelle de Kermas,</hi> he might have taken ſome courſe to have had her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched; for there was no man more violent, and he had ſo great authority in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as might make him undertake any thing without ſcruple. In fine, what ſhall I ſay? I perſwaded him that he had done me no great diskindneſs in diſentangling me from her. To compleat my cure, he ſent me to travel a little; but I came ſecretly back into the Country when I was believed to be at a great diſtance; and found an invention to ſee my dear <hi>Kermas,</hi> notwithſtanding my Fathers Cruelty, and the vigilance of the Governour of the Caſtle. I got into the Caſtle in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; and had been too happy in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her again whom I loved, although
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100358:165"/>ſhe was a Priſoner, if it could have laſted; but the misfortune that perſecuted me, at the ſame time inſpired revenge into the Brothers of <hi>Kermas,</hi> they laid an ambuſh for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he was at Hunting; but proving too weak, both died miſerably. One of them being ſearched after he was dead; there was found about him a piece of a Letter written with his Siſters hand; containing theſe words; <hi>I have written to you ſeveral times, Brother, prevent the Father of</hi> Monſieur de Kimperbel, <hi>or we ſhall be infallibly undone:</hi> it was the piece of a Letter wherein ſhe adviſed her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to acquaint my Father themſelves with our marriage before that he came to diſcover it by other means. She hoped that in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ancient Houſe of <hi>Kermas,</hi> and of the ſolicitation of ſome powerful friends, that might interpoſe for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he might have been brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to an alliance with them. But the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received not that interpretation. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought rather that ſhe had incited her Brothers to kill him; and the action that they had undertaken gave no ground of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherways. He came all in rage to his friends Caſtle; with a reſolution (ſeeing it was not yet known that he had cauſed her to be carried away) to make her a Companion to her two Brothers. The poor Priſoner had
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100358:165"/>notice of it before his coming: for ill intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence outflies the Poſt, and the news of her Brothers and her own misfortune came to her Ears before the Meſſenger arrived, whom he ſent expreſs to the Caſtle, to hinder her from knowing any thing that had paſſed, until he himſelf was come. Being ſtrucken as with a clap of thunder at the news of her two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, ſhe fell dead on the ground; and being near her time of delivery, the fall made her bring forth a Child whereof ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the inſtant, without riſing again. Since that time, I have run up and down, travelled and done all that I could to avoid the ſight of my Father, who was the cauſe of all the evils I ſuffered. But at length, time, ſome points of honour, the importunity of friends, and the deſires of a great Prince, made me reſolve to marry Madam <hi>de Kimperbel.</hi> Time, honour, importunitie, and the Prince, added he ſighing; have not been able however to blot the unfortunate <hi>Kermas</hi> out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. I have never truly enjoyed my ſelf ſince; and I believe (though I ſhould paſs for ridiculous, and a fanciful Fool) that ſhe appeared to me here two days ago, for no other end, but to acquaint me that ſhe ſtill loves me in the other world.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> who entertained themſelves in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100358:166"/>another place with the Chevalier <hi>de Montal,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> and little <hi>Luſigny,</hi> appeared at the end of the walk juſt as the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel</hi> made an end of his ſtory: And that he might not be expoſed to all the drollings of ſo brisk a Company, he took leave of the Hollander and Breton; and notwithſtanding the endeavours of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to detain him, and the great regret of the latter, he ſlipt out of the Garden, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all alone to <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi> Very pretty indeed! cried <hi>Montal,</hi> at a diſtance to the two Ladies, ye deſerve to be praiſed, Ladies, for having ventured without us upon a man who is haunted even by the beauties of the other world. The Hollander would have been glad not to have been obliged to anſwer him, becauſe impatient to queſtion <hi>Kermas</hi> about the matters ſhe had been hearing; but it behoved her to defer her curioſitie until night, when the lovely Breton and ſhe might according to their cuſtom be in Bed together. She made anſwer then to the Chevalier: It is true, Sir, and our diſcourſe has been only of love; but you ſee what a cruel part he acts, and how briskly he forſakes the people of this world. I gueſs at the reaſon of it, ſaid little <hi>Luſigny,</hi> it is becauſe he might not be put to anſwer thoſe who are not willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Spirits walk; but Ladies, hath he
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100358:166"/>told you the ſtory of that Lady whoſe Ghoſt hath appeared to him? upon my word there is not a better intrigue than that to be found in any Romance. Yes, anſwered <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Velzers,</hi> we know the whole matter; and God willing we ſhall know more by and by. She concluded not all ſhe intended to ſay, becauſe <hi>Mademoiſelle de Kermas</hi> made ſigns to her to ſpeak no more of it. But <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> who was curious, What can you know more, ſaid he to her, ſince you know the whole ſtory already? We ſhall know perhaps ſome other, anſwered ſhe, of <hi>Monſieur Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny,</hi> or of the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> for it cannot be but that they have met with ſome adventures. That was not the thing you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſay, replied the Chevalier; but he was interrupted by <hi>Mademoiſelle Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> who asked, who is the Gentleman here you call <hi>Monſieur Luſigny?</hi> That little man there, anſwered the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> pointing to him. I beg your pardon, Sir, ſaid ſhe to him, that I have not payed you my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, for I had not the honour to know you but by fame. How? Ladies, know ye not that that is the only Gentleman in <hi>France</hi> who can beſt tell you the ſtory of my bigot Lady? for ſhe has been in love with him. <hi>Luſigny</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to hear her ſpeak of him in ſuch terms. It will be a hard
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100358:167"/>matter for you not to ſatisfie the curioſitie of theſe Ladies, ſaid the Chevalier <hi>de Montal</hi> to him, no man enjoys the honour of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but that it coſts him a ſtory, and I have told mine. But, Ladies, anſwered <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny</hi> drolling, I am not yet weary of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the favours of fair Ladies, and if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed their ſecrets, I muſt needs renounce that. If you will not tell us the ſtory we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of you, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux,</hi> I'll tell it my ſelf. I know all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of your affairs; and give you warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides, that if I ſet to it I ſhall flatter no body; but even give every one their true name. I' faith, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> replied <hi>Luſigny,</hi> you may do what you pleaſe; but I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver publiſh the favours that have been ſhewed me. Good, good! ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> here is a new way of indiſcretion and babling; he will by no means tell his own affairs; but he will ſuffer others with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to tell them, and if need be will ſet his hand to all that one pleaſes to ſay. If I thought, anſwered he, that ſhe could ſpeak of a real intrigue, probably I ſhould be very carneſt with that fair Lady to ſpare the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned. But it is ſuch news to me to hear that one hath been in love with me, that I deſire quickly to be informed of the name and ſurname of her who hath had ſo
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100358:167"/>much charitie, and of all the circumſtances of ſo good a fortune. The excuſe is not bad, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne;</hi> but <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> is not about to forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all that. No, without doubt, ſaid ſhe: and this is the thing I know.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat honeſt Gentleman, for all he is ſo little, when he was in <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> made a luſty ſtrapping Laſs fall deeply in love with him. And that I may tell my ſtory according to the rules <hi>a la mode,</hi> I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Character of the fair one. She was red hair'd and deaf. This unlucky de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription made <hi>Luſigny</hi> bluſh. You do me, ſaid he, much honour, in beſtowing upon me ſo lovely a Miſtreſs. Have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, replied ſhe, I ſhall tell her perfections by and by; but muſt be a faithful Hiſtorian. She was then, as I have ſaid, red hair'd and deaf: nay, I might ſay alſo that ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dumb; for ſhe ſtuttered ſo that ſhe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100358:168"/>needed an hour to bring out a word. But to make amends for all, ſhe had the fineſt skin in the world, and was ſo fair that ſhe dazled the eyes of beholders. She was ſo compleat a beauty, that her eyes, noſe, mouth, ſtature; the upper and lower part of her face, her neck and breaſts, might have got her good ſtore of money, if ſhe would have ſuffered Painters to take a Copy of them. There is enough at leaſt to comfort me, replied he laughing, and her beauties are in greater number than her deformities. She was witty beſides, continued <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieux;</hi> her pen made a ſufficient reparation for the defect of her tongue. She turned things delicately, eaſily, waggiſhly, and in a word, into what ſenſe ſhe pleaſed according as occaſion ſerved. Neither was ſhe to be matched for copiouſneſs of invention: to write ten love Letters to her dear <hi>Luſigny</hi> in one day; was but a play to her. Ah! good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting her, ſhall we not ſee one of them? No, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> all are burnt. That Lover there has been ſo good as to make a Sacrifice of them, and it may be he does not repent it. But, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luſigny,</hi> one would think, to hear you ſpeak at that rate, that all you ſay were true: how come you then to have learnt ſo much? The
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100358:169"/>Marchioneſs of <hi>Vierſon,</hi> anſwered ſhe, gave me the relation: will that ſatisfie you? Ah! <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> replied he, if it be ſo, I yield; but the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vierſon</hi> is unfaithful, in having publiſhed things of that nature. But you are more, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> to him, for entruſting that Marchioneſs with the ſecret. Not ſo, Madam, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> for ſhe was witneſs to their rupture: that is then the Character of the fair Lady <hi>de Ravenois,</hi> added ſhe; for I muſt not forget to name her. They made their firſt acquaintance at the waters of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and continued it ſince at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where they have ſeen one another. <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny</hi> hath given it out that he had much ado to perſwade the Lady to love him; but that is a tale, for ſhe declared her ſelf firſt. He talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her of Maids that had the weakneſs to ſuffer men to come in their preſence again, after that they had been unfaithful to them. And when he thought himſelf very far from being beloved, and if I miſtake not farther from being in love: <hi>Fo-fo- for my part,</hi> ſaid ſhe ſtuttering, <hi>n-n- none o-o- of theſe m-m-maids, and fo-fo- for inſtance, if-if-if you had b-b- been once un-un-faithful to me, you ſhould ne-never re-regain m-my eſteem.</hi> O how malicious you are, <hi>Mademoiſelle!</hi> ſaid <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny</hi> at theſe words; and how do you pinch
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100358:169"/>that poor Maid? ſhe ſtuttered not half ſo bad. That's no matter replied ſhe, it is true ſtill that ſhe told you that. Afterward love encreaſed daily; and I ſhall not ſpend time to tell you all that paſſed betwixt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell to it in earneſt; it is drawing late, and I can tell you ſomewhat that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Ye muſt only know, that as love encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that fair one felt in her heart a violent deſire to learn to make Verſes. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has a gallant knack that way, took thereupon pretext to ſee her often at her Houſe: and this commerce laſted until that her Mother began to find fault with it. You are godly and devote, Daughter, ſaid ſhe to her; you are an enemy to love; and would have people to think ſo; reconcile in the mean time, that, I pray, with the reſt, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> and in a word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the good Mother, you would have none of your Companions ſo much as look upon a man, and yet you ſuffer one to be alone with you in your Chamber? that's not well. And to this remonſtrance the Mother having added a prohibition; ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to keep her aſſignations elſewhere. A Seamſter, the pattern of devotion to all the Neighbourhood, and who was wont to make Handkerchiefs for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venois,</hi> gave her the uſe of her Houſe, that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100358:170"/>ſhe might take her Leſſons of Poetry there. There were two Keys made for one Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the party that came firſt went in and ſtayed for the other. I dare not tell you the policie that the fair one made uſe of to order matters ſo commodiouſly as to obſerve her times of Rendezvous without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her Servants. It is enough to tell you that her Coach ſtayed for her at the Gate of a Monaſtery, and that when ſhe came from another place, it ſeemed that ſhe always came thence from her devotion. That virtuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe laſted above two years; during which it is ſaid ſhe might have brought to light ſome ſine pieces of her one production, if ſhe had pleaſed. She hatched a very natural and gallant work; but ſome conſiderations made her look upon the piece as a thing miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Maid, who made it a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to hate all kind of gallantry. She ſtifled the work, and the deſire ſhe might have had to publiſh it, at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Upon my faith, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> ſaid the Hero of the ſtory, again interrupting her, you are a very dangerous enemy, and it is not good to diſpleaſe you. What do you mean by that? replied ſhe: is it to be the enemy of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to relate their laudable actions? I aſſure you there are a great many Authors who have not ſo great command over themſelves
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100358:170"/>as to ſuppreſs their works, as ſhe did, though they know that they are not like to bring them much reputation; but let me come to a concluſion.</p>
               <p>They were very punctual then during the ſpace of two years, in keeping their aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the Seamſters Houſe. <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny</hi> was ſatisfied with her; and no body elſe who might have had a mind to teach the fair one, would have been made welcome. All that ſhe wrote now was only directed to him; but afterwards ſhe had an itching deſire to try the art of ſome others. A man of great quality paſſing that way to go to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſeemed to her by his looks to be a good Poet. She imagined that his quality muſt needs ſuggeſt to him more lofty thoughts than thoſe of <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny,</hi> and yet I think ſhe might have been miſtaken. But to be ſhort, ſhe did all ſhe could to draw in that man of quality. Love Letters flew ding dong; and though he ſlighted her, yet he failed not to ſend her an anſwer. It became one of thoſe Love intrigues, which if they ſeize not the heart, ſerve at leaſt for matter of pleaſant diſcourſe to a man when he is with his friends. <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſmelt out the matter, became terribly jealous; for it was ſaid, that he loved his Scholar with all his little heart. He diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100358:171"/>her about the thing, made heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to her, and in progreſs of time fell even into a little more fury than is allowed a gallant man to uſe againſt a woman: he treated her as one of our Dukes the other day treated the fair Counteſs of <hi>Monſalva,</hi> I mean that they made love at fifty-cuffs. Do you ſay, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> replied <hi>Montal;</hi> that the Counteſs of <hi>Monſalva</hi> hath been box'd? good now! what Country have I lived in then, that I have known nothing of it? but by your favour, added he, I beg <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny</hi>'s pardon, if I interrupt you; tell me that ſtory before you conclude his. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> made the following relation.</p>
               <p>My Lord Duke of ...... it is needleſs to name him; is the good friend of the Counteſs of <hi>Monſaiva,</hi> and a man of parts. She is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe witty, and that is, as ſhe ſays, the only cauſe of their friendſhip. In the mean time another Duke being pleaſed with the Ladies converſation, and having rendered her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits; the good friend became jealous of him. He prayed her not to receive that other Duke any more. She told him, that it was difficult, yea and ill manners to cauſe her ſelf be denied to a perſon of that quality Madam, ſaid the firſt Duke, that is difficult indeed for one that loves him; but ſo much
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100358:171"/>the worſe for you if you be gulled by him; it is a Sacrifice which you muſt make to me. How! do you ſay I muſt? replied ſhe; that's well indeed; you talk to me as if you were my Maſter. I am your Ladyſhips Servant, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he; but, Madam, if you will ſuffer me to tell you plainly, it is ſufficient that you have permitted me to be ſo; to ſtop any other from pretending to it. At that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy grew hot; and treated her Gallant with higheſt contempt. He anſwered her alſo with ſlights. And ſhe being ſomewhat more nettled at them than he, gave him a Box on the Ear: he returned her the like; and ſo both fell fairly to Cuffs.</p>
               <p>There is a Leſſon for you, Ladies, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> that you ſhould never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men any advantage over you. But it is rather one for you, replied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> for it was not a Maid that was ſo cuffed.</p>
               <p>The Rival, continued ſhe, arrived during the ſcuffle. The firſt Duke being informed that he was already coming up ſtairs, and that the Lady, though in that condition, allowed him acceſs; buſled out like a mad man, his Hat pulled down over his brows, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do worſe ſtill than what he had done. The other Duke perceiving the Lady all in tears, and that ſhe had thrown her ſelf upon
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100358:172"/>the Bed; Madam, ſaid he, what do you ail, and what has put you into that condition? A Cholick, Sir, anſwered ſhe; but it has juſt now left me. He gueſſed indeed that ſhe was troubled with choler, for he had eſpied the Cholick marching out by a back door. Would to God! Madam, replied he ſmiling, my Sword might do you ſome ſervice in revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of that Cholick, I ſhould offer it you with all my heart. By that anſwer the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs was a little vexed, to ſind that he was not fully perſwaded ſhe was ſick. I pretend not here to relate to you the whole Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But the ſecond Duke whom ſhe would not ſacrifice to the firſt, ſacrificed her to the publick. He diſcovered the whole adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereat ſhe was not a little aſhamed. And this is the ſtory of the Counteſs of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you ſuffer me to add ſomewhat to it? ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle Velzers.</hi> What you pleaſe, anſwered <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux.</hi> I'll on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you then, replied the Hollander, that that ſame ſecond Duke is a very naughty man for having publiſhed that adventure which never happened but in his own imagination. And becauſe he was jealous of the former, and mad to find him always with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, who was too virtuous for him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged himſelf on her by that calumny. It is
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100358:172"/>true, ſaid the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain,</hi> if one would believe all the fopperies that are ſaid of women, there would be very few of them honeſt; for the moſt virtuous do not go free. However there is much more Gallantry than real naughtineſs in <hi>France;</hi> and a Lady from whom ſome man brags that he hath received all kind of favours, hath never perhaps been ſeen by him, or at leaſt he durſt never have the confidence to look her in the face. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Marqueſs, replied Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> we are much obliged to you for taking our part; and indeed you have reaſon; for I freely confeſs, though I be a woman, that we are a little too fond of Courtſhip. We love that men ſhould render us ſervices, languiſh, lament, and in a word, that they ſhould uſe all the arts and ways that are neceſſary to obtain their ends on us; we our ſelves ſuffer ſometimes, we languiſh, and ſigh; but all is Vanity, and I may ſay on my Conſcience there is no reality in the thing. That is well indeed for Wives, ſaid <hi>Montal;</hi> but as to the Maids? I ſay nothing as to that, added Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> let them anſwer for themſelves. We ſhall eaſily anſwer, ſaid the Maids all at a time; but it is not of them that people talk moſt. Ah! what is that you ſay, cried the Chevalier? There is not one of them without an intrigue, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100358:173"/>the ſcandalous Chronicle. One leaps over the Cloyſter Walls where ſhe is kept at Penſion, that ſhe may go ſpend the night with her Gallant. He ſtays for her every night at a certain hour, mounted on a great Horſe. He ſtands upon the Saddle that he may take her down from the Wall, and ſets her up again before day.</p>
               <p>Two others beg leave of the Lady Abbeſs to go ſolicite a ſuit at Law. She ſends along with them an old won to bear them Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They ask the old Maid if ſhe know the Preſidents Son, thinking that ſhe knows him not; they make her believe that he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them at a Merchants Houſe; that he may give them account of their buſineſs. Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is made ready. In comes the Preſidents Son. Good morrow, ſay they, Marqueſs of <hi>Chanleux;</hi> but by ill luck it is the Marqueſs of <hi>Luzan,</hi> whom they adopted for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents Son, and the old Nun knew him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they.</p>
               <p>A great Prince entertains another, who had likewiſe eſcaped out of Convent, with a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Ball. She allows him no more time but till ten of the Clock, becauſe ſhe expects a friend; but the Prince tranſgreſſes his hour. That friend frets and dies for cold in the Court of a Nunnery, waiting till the Prince be gone. The Maid not knowing how to be
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100358:173"/>rid of him, and fearing that the other might find difficulty to get into the Houſe if the hour was paſt, and that after the departure of the Prince from the Ball, a certain door might be lookt; ſends him the Princes own blew Coat which he had laid aſide whilſt he was dancing. The Coat ſtealing away in this manner, interrupted the dance a little; for it was very rich. The fair one takes occaſion to break up the Ball, and the Prince departs, after whom the door that I have told you of was ſhut. The other came half a quarter of an hour after with the Coat which ſerved him for a Paſs port. He is taken for the Prince, who had forgotten to ſay ſomewhat to the young Lady; ſhe was already in Bed, and he muſt needs ſpeak with her there; but the Landladies Chamber Maid unſeaſonably open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curtains at the Beds feet.</p>
               <p>I have, to be ſhort, a liſt, continued the Chevalier, of a thouſand pretty pranks that have been played by Maids, and the coyeſt have their times; after all this do you think they give no occaſion of talk? Men talk of them without doubt, ſaid <hi>Luſigny,</hi> but they will give you the ſame anſwer as the Wives do, that there is no reality in their intrigues. There is a great difference between the two, replied <hi>Montal,</hi> and Wives have far leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than they to take care. He is about to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100358:174"/>tell us fooleries again, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle do Barbiſieux,</hi> interrupting him, if we leave not this ſubject. I faith, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> replied he, I tell not ſo many as you do, and conſidering how you took me up the other day, I thought you had been a great deal more ſcrupulous than you are; but thanks be to Heaven and the ſtories that you have told, and eſpecially to that of <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny;</hi> I perceive at length, that the brisk and merry way of diſcourſe does not diſpleaſe you. O! that's true; ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> ſhall we not have an end then of that ſtory of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Luſigny?</hi> Pardon me, ye ſhall; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> and I ſhall preſently conclude it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny</hi> and ſhe cuffed together then. The Maid ſo abuſed, out of meer ſpight found the Rival handſomer than him; yet they were made friends again; However from that time ſhe made uſe of a great many Leſſons of ſubtlety which ſhe learnt of her Lover, beſides Poetry, to cheat himſelf as well as others. When the little man came to diſcover it, his fury grew much greater than before. He ſtood no more upon Ceremonies; but told all people what he knew of her, and even began with his Rival, to whom he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Letters: he affronted the fair one by reproaching her with the commerce that they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100358:174"/>had held together, before a Company that took her for a Saint. He dared Heaven and Earth, obliged his Rival to fight him; and in a word played the little Devil. Ah! <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur Luſigny,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; what horrible impreſſions do you here give of me? Without doubt, Sir, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> you are a dangerous Gallant, if you can ſo cruelly revenge your ſelf on a Maid whom you formerly loved. No, no, Madam, replied he, I muſt repair my honour by ending the ſtory my ſelf. I am not ſo raſh-tongued as that Lady would perſwade you. I concealed almoſt three years the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent commerce that I entertained with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoſelle de Ravenois,</hi> and it is not my fault but her own, if any thing of it be come to light.</p>
               <p>When I diſcovered all her infidelities, and that ſhe abuſed me, anger and jealouſie did indeed ſeize my heart. I thought that I had juſt right to entreat her to admit my Rival no more. I accompanied my entreaty with a little ſharpneſs. She anſwered me, that ſhe would not admit either of us any more, but was not ſo faithful to her promiſe, for ſhe kept her new Lover daily Company, and it was I alone whom ſhe would ſee no more. That way of carriage put me into a rage; and a friend of mine who pitied my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100358:175"/>undertook to deliver her a Letter in my name. She refuſed it ſcoffingly, as if it had been a great novelty that I ſhould offer to write to her; which made me ſtark ſtaring mad. I endeavoured however to imagine that my Meſſenger, to whom ſhe was not willing to own our Commerce, was rather the cauſe of her refuſal, than that ſhe wholly ſlighted me. But my Rival came to ſee me after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and told me, that he knew ſomewhat of the matter: he had probably a mind to divert himſelf with my diſorder, that he might have occaſion afterwards to laugh and make ſport at it with her. That gave me ground to conclude there was an intimacy betwixt them; and was ſuch a proof of my misfortune as quite deprived me of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Next day I met him again as he was fetching a walk. He made it his buſineſs to ſpeak to me again of that refuſed Letter. What in Gods name, ſaid he to me, hath put it into your head to fall in love with <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Ravenois,</hi> and to ſend her love Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? you know that ſhe is the moſt indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and jearing Maid in the World; and by ſo ſaying he himſelf put a little dry jeaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. But for all that, anſwered I, what do you think if ſhe ſhould not always refuſe them, if I did but ſend them by the hands of one whom ſhe likes. And whom would you
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:100358:175"/>employ? replied he. Your ſelf, ſaid I, if you will take the pains. How me! cried he, by no means. I ſhould be too much afraid that ſeeing jealous Lovers are haſty, you might inſert in it ſome high words, which might make me be thrown out at the Window; at leaſt I would deſire to know before-hand the contents of the Letter. O! with all my heart, ſaid I. And with that I pluckt it out of my pocket, and gave him the reading of it. At every word my Blade changed colour; and that ſeemed to me a ſmall beginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. It would ſeem by that note, ſaid he, that ſhe had obſerved a very free and intimate way of converſation with you? What do you mean? anſwered I. A Lover knows not what he writes, and if he be jealous, he may fancy things that never were true. Shortly after we took our leaves; and he making no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence but that he would go meet my unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miſtreſs in <hi>Red hat ſtreet,</hi> where ſhe was to ſpend the whole Afternoon with two of her Coſins; I followed him at ſome diſtance, and went into the Houſe after him. There was a brisk Company met there. Good Friends follow one another, ſaid one of them who partly knew our affairs; how is it that they come both together? He anſwered, that we did not come together; and that he might begin to entertain the Ladies with ſome
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100358:176"/>thing, he pretended that he had had ſome ſmall adventures in his walk. And to make him mad, I pretended ſomething alſo. I am more fortunate than that Gentleman, ſaid I, to the Company, for I found under my feet a note worth ten of the Gentlemans adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It is certainly the Letter of a jealous Lover, added I, and it is to my liking ſo pleaſantly conceived, that it will not diſpleaſe you to hear it read. At theſe words I had the ſatisfaction to ſee my Rival more and more perplexed, and at a diſtance to revenge my ſelf of my unconſtant Lady, in forcing her by that ſtratagem to learn what was in the note. She had not ſtrength enough however to hear it out. A real or counterfeit indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave her a pretext to go out of the room before it was ended. This is all I did, Ladies; but this is not to publiſh a commerce that one hath had with a Miſtreſs; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Rival whom I was willing to inform of all, none of the Company could ever have conjectured that it was addreſſed to her, if matters had gone no farther. Pardon me! ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> you ſhewed the Letters that you had received from her to my Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Vierſon.</hi> It is true, anſwered he; but if what I did at that time, be not the part of a Gentleman, there is none living; any other beſides my ſelf would have
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100358:176"/>done as much. I underſtood that inſtead of endeavouring to uſe me civilly, ſhe jeaſted and flouted at my love. I payed a viſit to that Marchioneſs; ſhe laughed at my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; the perſidious Miſtreſs had made her believe that ſhe was ſo far from having any eſteem for me, that ſhe knew me not. I my ſelf heard her ſay. <hi>Alas! Poor little man; what, is</hi> Monſieur de Luſigny <hi>in love with me? how vexed am I that I did not know it ſooner!</hi> I heard worſe than this, and yet I have two hundred Letters by me, which are not only very tender, but full of tranſports and amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceits. Good Heavens! what kind of Lover muſt I have been, if to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that I deſerved no ſuch ſlights, I had not ſhewed theſe Letters? But I ſhewed them not as in triumph; but was only willing that the Marchioneſs might not think me a Fool, without ſome reaſon of being ſo. I went home, I took all theſe irrefragable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the imprudence of my cruel Miſtreſs, brought them to that Lady; here, ſaid I, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her them to read; conſider, if I be well uſed, and if a faithleſs Lady treat thoſe ſo well for whom ſhe has no eſteem; think then how ſhe behaves her ſelf towards thoſe ſhe loves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luſigny</hi> grew hot in reflecting on his amours, ſo that it ſeemed he was ſtill enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100358:177"/>in the diſpute. Ah! good little Sir, ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> you are not as yet compleatly cured, and even at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, you are angry with your deteſtable Miſtreſs. No, anſwered he, I aſſure you ſhe is now very indifferent to me; or at leaſt if at any time I think of her, it is only heartily to hate her. I make no doubt of that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> laughing; there are a great many ſuch. They had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continually think on their unfaithful Miſtreſſes, to hate them, than not to have the pleaſure of thinking on them at all. To tell you the truth, replied he, it is no eaſie matter to ſhake off a violent paſſion, and I would not ſwear that I could ſee that Lady again, without ſome ſenſible agitation of mind; ſhe has been two Months at <hi>Paris;</hi> and as I was ſpeaking the other day to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of Parliament in his Robes, who did me the honour to hear me attentively; ſhe paſſed by in the Gallery of the Palace where we were. So ſoon as I ſaw her, my words ſtuck in my throat, when I intended to have ſpoken to the beſt purpoſe. The Preſident perceiving me change colour, asked me where was my heart; and to ſave my reputation I was obliged to confeſs frankly that it was gone after that fair one to a Merchants Shop. But, ſaid Madam <hi>de Moulionne,</hi> interrupting
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100358:177"/>him, is it poſſible that one can be ſo much in love with a deaf, ſtuttering, and red-haired Miſtreſs? Madam, anſwered he, you muſt not rely on the Character that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux</hi> hath given you of her; ſince I have the honour to know her; with her leave I may tell you, that ſhe has ground to be much diſpleaſed with poor <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ravenois;</hi> for that ſame deaf, ſtuttering, red-haired Girl, was like to have deprived her of an Adorer. Ho! ho! ſaid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> you have not told us a word of that? Pardon me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe; did I not tell you, that a Bigot endeavoured to play me a thouſand pranks; but the Lady <hi>de Ravenois</hi> might very well have made uſe of my Adorer, and not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me of him; and I excuſe <hi>Monſieur de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigny</hi> who is ſtill in love; that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me to her. Ah! replied he, if that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, I deſigned no compariſon. Continue your ſtory, replied ſhe, and afterward you ſhall know by mine, that the grounds which I have to complain of your fair one, are not ſuch as you imagine.</p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs of <hi>Vierſon,</hi> continued he, read all the Letters with great amazement, and cried, that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ravenois</hi> was much in the wrong to have ſo provoked my patience, knowing that I had ſo ſtrong
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100358:178"/>Weapons againſt her. O, how deceitful are Maids now adays! added ſhe: who is to be truſted, if ſuch a one as ſhe can do what I ſee? But ſeeing ſhe was one of her friends, ſhe prayed me however not to divulge theſe Letters. You muſt, ſaid ſhe, have ſome reſpect for her relations if you have none for her ſelf; and conſider, that ſhe is a Maid of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to whom you may do an irreparable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice if the matter come to be known. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered I, to make appear to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Lady that I never deſerved the uſage that I have received from her; I pray you deliver her back all theſe Letters, the firſt time you ſee her; and I ask no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, but that ſhe would let me reſt in peace, and not force me to undo her by undoing my ſelf, if ſhe have not a care not to reduce me to deſpair. The Marchioneſs delivered back into her hands that packet of Letters; and omitted not to tell her every thing that was uſeful for her reputation; but my perfidious Miſtreſs, inſtead of having, as ſhe ought to have had, ſome regret for treating ſo ill a man, who, as I think, had behaved himſelf very generouſly towards her; broke out againſt me without any reſerve when ſhe found me diſarmed of the Letters whereby I might do her prejudice. From deſpiſing my love ſhe came to undervalue my perſon. She
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100358:178"/>inſtigated my Rival to revenge her on me for the greateſt proofs that I ever gave her of my love, to wit my modeſt complaints. Upon refuſal of that Marqueſs; (for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that diſorder, he hath always honoured me with ſome eſteem) ſhe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Champions of inferiour quality; ſo that I was ſet upon one Evening and parted. They traiterouſly came back upon me; but I lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned, and revenged my ſelf on one of my Enemies, whom I wounded. At the ſame time I left <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and came to <hi>Paris</hi> to fall in love with a pair of big eyes with whom I lodged. That ſecond paſſion baniſhed the firſt; but ſtill I met with as little tranquillitie there. The place was already taken, and I ſerved only to render it ſuſpected. Beſides, that my nymph was ſomewhat more diſcreet and circumſpect than I deſired, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection kills me. I had almoſt poiſoned my ſelf and fought once more for this Miſtreſs; nor could I find any other ſecret to make me forget her, but by embracing a third Amour, who though ſhe be a little more gentle, will nevertheleſs prove more troubleſome than the others. Lord have mercy upon me, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for I have told you all the faults of my life.</p>
               <p>When he had made an end, Madam <hi>de Moulionne</hi> told him: You are not much to be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:100358:179"/>blamed, Sir, if matters be ſo; and the Lady <hi>de Ravenois</hi> very well deſerved her diſgrace. Who ever heard of imprudence like to hers; to know that a man had ſo many inſtruments of revenge, and not to carry fairer with him? Though a Maid have no commerce with a man, yet ſhould ſhe never openly ſlight him, and if ſhe do, it will certainly turn to her ſhame. At leaſt, ſaid the Marqueſs of <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain</hi> laughing, little men are never to be ſlighted; for they overflow with courage. I wiſh I had been in the place of <hi>Monſieur de Luſigny,</hi> cried <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux;</hi> I ſhould have revenged my ſelf on the Bigot in another manner than he hath done! But, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, anſwered <hi>Luſigny,</hi> I do not think that I have ſaid any thing that may accuſe me of revenge; on the contrary, I think I have had patience enough, yea and much more than <hi>Mademoiſelle de Barbiſieux,</hi> though ſhe has met with far leſs abuſe from her than I have done. You know not the tricks ſhe has play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, replied that Lady. Is that ſo great a wrong, ſaid the Chevalier to her drily, to borrow from you a Lover? ſhe reſtored him again, and we ought not to complain, when what we have lent is reſtored. You are about to judge preſently, if the hatred that I have to her be juſt or no, and with that ſhe was going to begin another ſtory; but ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:100358:179"/>that the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> was returned, and the curioſity that ſhe and the reſt had, to go learn what news he had got of <hi>Clelia,</hi> made her defer it till another time.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs was at the Houſe of fair <hi>Clelia</hi>'s Aunt, where he met with no body but the Son of the old Lady very melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for the loſs of his Coſin. He found him a little indiſpoſed and in Bed, and all that he could draw from him, was, that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected who were the Authors of that rape, and that the Lady his Mother was ſtill at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau,</hi> to learn better information of it. But upon his return to <hi>Vaux,</hi> he diſcovered much more of the matter. He ſaw the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Clelia</hi> in the ſame Coach, wherein in all probabilitie ſhe had been carried away. He ſaw the fair haired Gentleman that he had been told of, who inceſſantly kiſſed her hand whether ſhe would or not; the fair one ſate in the hinder part of the Coach, and the Gentleman in the boot. Two Ladies whom he knew not or could not know, ſate in the forepart of that Coach which was open on all ſides. He endeavoured to croſs a little River that was between him and the Coach, that he might come up with it more ſpeedily; but it was impoſſible for him to do it. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to fetch a great compaſs to find
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:100358:180"/>the Ford: in the mean time the Coach was gone a great way off; for it drove very ſwiftly. All that the Marqueſs could do was to keep in ſight of it, and ſpur on after. And yet all his diligence was to no purpoſe; for when he thought that he had juſt overtaken it, he found it in the middle of the <hi>Sein,</hi> in a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Boat that carried it over to the other ſide of the River. The Ferry-man would not come back to ferry over the Marqueſs alſo, ſo that he had that cruel diſpleaſure of loſing ſo fair an occaſion of rendering a conſiderable piece of ſervice to the poor indiſpoſed Lady. He related this unfortunate adventure to the Company who came to meet him as far as the middle of the great Graſ-plot; which occaſioned long reaſonings on the novelty of thoſe accidents, that were judged every way ſutable to a perſon who imagined her ſelf <hi>Clelia.</hi> In the mean while the Marqueſs wrote to the fair Ladies Kinſman, and ordered his Servant to carry the Letter in haſt, that her Aunt might be acquainted with the news, and that ſhe might queſtion the Ferry-man whom he ſuſpected to have been gained by the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher. Night came on all of a ſudden, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after: and the Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> and <hi>Luſigny,</hi> were invited to Supper and to ſtay there that night, that they might partake of the diverſions that the Company ſhould
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:100358:180"/>follow next day. The Marqueſs of <hi>Mireſtain</hi> had buſineſs to do at Court, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to return to <hi>Fountainbleau;</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come back the day following, and left them little <hi>Luſigny</hi> as a pledge of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Afterward they fetched a little walk, and went to Supper. They drank to the health of <hi>Clelia,</hi> and gave the Marqueſs of <hi>Riberville</hi> no leiſure to lament the abſence of that fair one. After Supper they began their converſation, inſiſting moſt on ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and detractions that were commonly vented, and then all went to Bed to the great contentment of the fair Hollander, who was impatient to be alone with her friend <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>

We are by our ſelves, and you may confidently diſcover to me that great myſterie. Was it of you that he ſpake? or is it of a Siſter of yours, or of ſome other perſon of your name? It is of my ſelf, anſwered <hi>Mademoi'ſelle de Kermas,</hi> it is above four years ago ſince he hath believed me in my Grave. But, replied <hi>Velzers,</hi> he ſaid that you died in Child-birth: have you born a Child then? Why not? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Breton, you need not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at that, ſince you have heard that I was married. Other adventures are called Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100358:181"/>ſtories, replied the Hollander, but if ever there was any, this is one. Have you been married, with Child, dead and buried, and do you paſs ſtill for a jolly Virgin? Maids who have had miſchances, ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, ſince there is ſo little to be ſeen in you. Make haſt and tell me by what miracle all that hath happened, added ſhe.

               <p>
                  <hi>MOnſieur de Kimperbel</hi> hath related to us his ſtory in ſo few words, and hath skipped ſo many pretty cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that to give you the pleaſure of hearing it intirely, I had beſt begin it again of new. The Gallantries that he uſed to pleaſe me before our marriage: the arts he contrived to get into the Caſtle where I was Priſoner, after his Father cauſed me to be carried away: his diſguiſes and many other
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100358:182"/>ſtratagems that he put in practice to deceive the Sentinels, and to make himſelf known to me when I came to my Priſon Window: All theſe I ſay, my dear <hi>Velzers,</hi> might be truly called Romantick adventures, if to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row they were not too true. The ambition of my Brothers was the cauſe that I conſented to the private marriage you have heard of. I made long reſiſtance againſt it, though I was paſſionately in love with the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel;</hi> and it ſeemed that my heart fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the troubleſome conſequents thereof. I likewiſe wrote that fatal Letter whereof the ſad piece which was found about one of my Brothers, was ſo ill interpreted and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo terrible effects. In a word, I omitted nothing that might divert the cruel ſtorm that I ſaw ready to break upon us. But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny was too hard for my ſmall prudence; our Enemies diſcovered to <hi>Monſieur de Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbel</hi> the marriage of his Son, before thoſe who might have been able to mitigate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, could do it. You know the reſt. When I was thinking to go ſeek a Sanctuary at <hi>Rennes,</hi> and there to find my Brothers to whom I had already ſent a deputation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the validitie of my marriage; I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, and ſhut up in a Caſtle; and to Cloak my abſence, it was given out that I had retired into a Monaſtery: that I forſook my
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100358:183"/>defence: that I conſented to be unmarried, that I might become a Nun; and I was forced having a Dagger held to my breaſt, even to write ſo to my two Brothers: to ſend them that conſent ſigned with my hand: to entreat them not to inquire into the place of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; and in a word, to do every thing that was neceſſary to give my Husbands Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Victory. My poor unfortunate Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were themſelves like to have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined; for the cruel man finding them obſtinate to maintain my marriage whether I would or not, revived the buſineſs of an old Duel that they had been concerned in above fifteen years before: and if they had not fled for it, they had been made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick example; for the authority of their enemy prevailed to make them be ſentenced to loſe their heads. As to the poor Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel,</hi> God knows what grief he ſelt; for he tenderly loved me. However he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, as he told you, his diſcontent. He conſented to travel for ſome time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſecretly into the Country, having left ſeveral Letters with one of his friends, who ſent them to his Father, being all dated from towns through which he ſhould have paſſed. Fearing to be known again, he diſguiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and not knowing how to ſee or ſpeak to me; he could find no better expedient
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100358:183"/>than to hire himſelf to a Fiſherman of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laix,</hi> who went uſually a fiſhing about my Priſon. Can there be greater love than that? I was lodged in a tower where there was a kind of Balcony that jutted out a little into the Sea, and I had no other diverſion but to walk there ſometimes with a young Country Girl that was cunning and handſome, and who was given me rather for a ſpie than ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. The Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that place; and it was that which put him in the mind of hiring himſelf to the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman; he hoped that I might caſt mine eyes upon him and know him amongſt the reſt when I came to ſee the fiſhing, which was, as I have told you, my ſole recreation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came there ſeveral times before I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on that Balcony; I was over-whelmed with melancholy, and being no more ſenſible of pleaſure; for ſeveral days I had neglected to go thither for my uſual divertiſement, it behoved him to draw me out by ſome art, and this he made uſe of for that purpoſe. During our proſperitie which laſted but too ſhort a time, he was wont to ſing ſome Verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was much taken with the Air; it was one of the Airs of the great ballet of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in Love;</hi> you who delight in muſick, muſt certainly remember it, and it was that wherein theſe Verſes are to be found.</p>

               <p>He fell a ſinging the ſame Air in his Bark, yet not with the ſame ſweetneſs of voice as he was accuſtomed to do; on the contrary, he made it as clowniſh and Country like as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could, to avoid ſuſpicion. But yet it was no ſmall novelty in that Country, to hear a Fiſherman ſing Court Songs; and it made the Maid that waited on me very curious to go to the Balcony. That Girl took as much pleaſure to ſee him at to hear him ſing; for you may believe that notwithſtanding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe there muſt needs remain ſomething that was ſtill agreeable in the perſon of ſuch a man as he; to be ſhort, ſhe became ſo charmed that ſhe could take no reſt till ſhe perſwaded me to go out into the Balcony to hear that lovely Fiſherman. At firſt I minded not what
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100358:184"/>was in my view; but when I ſaw him ſalute us, and that through all his diſguiſe, love told me that he muſt be one who ought to be dear unto me; when likewiſe I had called to mind the Air and words of the Song; I felt my ſelf in ſo great diſorder that I was like to have loſt the uſe of all my ſenſes. I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that unfortunate perſon more narrowly; I perceived he was my Marqueſs, and his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable equipage moved my heart with a more tender paſſion than all the pomp whereby he formerly ſtrove to pleaſe me. He likewiſe perceived very well that I knew him; and we would willingly have ſpoken together; but he durſt not. The Watch perhaps would not have ſuffered it, though they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſee theſe Fiſhermen who came there only by permiſſion of the Governour of the Caſtle; and for my part I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to truſt the Maid that ſerved me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever being perſwaded that the Marqueſs had not in that manner diſguiſed himſelf without ſome great deſign, I uſed my endeavours to gain the Maid and to engage her in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; and I found her favourably inclined to the matter. My Amorous Fiſherman had made it his buſineſs whilſt he was at his work, to talk merrily with her, to make it believed that his deſign was only on her, who as I have ſaid was pretty handſome, and ſhe was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100358:185"/>ſmitten with him. I adviſed her to order her affairs ſo as that ſhe might obtain him for her Husband. I promiſed her a Diamond which I wore on my Finger, worth three or four hundred Crowns, if that might do the buſineſs and make her happy. The Maid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the matter to the Lieutenant of the Caſtle who was her Gallant; not a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Gallant; for in my very ſight they had ſuch familiarities one with another, as made me ſuſpect they were not ceremonious when they were at greater diſtance from me. This Lieutenant who feared that ſhe might ſhortly ſtand in need of a Husband to ſerve him for an excuſe, thought the occaſion fair and laid hold on it. He made the Fiſherman bring fiſh often into the Caſtle, and ſent him with them to my Chamber, that he might thereby have the opportunity to ſee the Maid at nearer diſtance. The Marqueſs of <hi>Kimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> played his part ſo well, and I mine, that we found time to ſpeak together; and he acquainted me with the deſign he had to make my eſcape. It would be to no purpoſe to tell you the meaſures that he took, for as you know they took no effect. In ſine, he came daily to the Caſtle and it was about the time when my Brothers endeavoured that unhappy exploit; that <hi>Monſieur de Kimperbel</hi> coming to cauſe me to be put to death, as well
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100358:185"/>as them: I fell in a ſwoon at the news, was delivered of a Child, and believed to be dead.</p>
               <p>I was in diſcourſe with my poor Marqueſs in private, upon pretext of ſpeaking to him for the Country Girl, when the Lieutenant of the Caſtle came to tell me of the death of my Brothers, and that the report was that I was acceſſory to their attempt. And as if I had been ſtrucken with a thunderbolt, I fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the Arms of the Fiſherman, who being no leſs afflicted than I at the ſad news, wanted ſtrength to hold me up, and let me fall rudely on the floor. I was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be dead with the fall, and being near my time, I brought forth a Child that lived not a minute after it was born. I leave you to gueſs what condition the Marqueſs of <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbel</hi> was in at the ſight of ſo ſad an accident. They ſay the poor man was in deſpair, and quickly diſcovered who he was, to the great wonder of thoſe who had been the witneſſes of his actions. There was no ſeparating of him from my body which he embraced moſt dolefully, and made ſuch lamentations over it as might have ſoftened and affected the moſt barbarous and hard heart. How often did he deteſt and abominate his Fathers cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and only ſhunned his preſence for fear of being tempted to revenge himſelf upon
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:100358:186"/>him for my death: to be ſhort, he gave, as I have been told, ſo extraordinary proofs of love in that ſad conjuncture, that it ſeems not at all ſtrange to me that his paſſion ſtill endures. His Father who upon his arrival was informed of the diſguiſe and arts that he had practiſed to come to ſight of me, felt ſuch an exceſs of rage, as could only be modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the news of my death. He deſired to ſee my body that he might not be impoſed upon; and that accident ſeemed to him the more incredible the leſs he expected it, and that it ſaved him from committing a great crime. Afterwards he ordered my body to be ſpeedily interred, without having any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the reaſon of a Phyſician who deſired that I ſhould be kept at leaſt forty hours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very uſual with women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to fall into a kind of Lethargie, which hath all the ſigns of death, and yet not die. My Child and I were buried in one Coffin, and laid in a Vault of the Chappel of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle where ſome of the Governours had been interred.</p>
               <p>In truth, ſaid the Hollander interrupting her, you tell me very ſtrange things; but how comes it that the Coffin and Vault did not really kill you? You ſhall know that, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Kermas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After my interment, <hi>Monſieur de Kimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:100358:186"/>the Father returned home and commanded that his Son ſhould inſtantly be brought to him; but his grief had already made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in purſuance of the travels which he told you he made: the cruel Father could never mitigate the diſcontent which he had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to him. He was two years before he ſaw him, and the poor Marqueſs of <hi>Kimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> returned and married his Lady only for the reaſons which you know already. For my part I lay buried until Midnight, at which time the Country Maid that ſerved me, and the Chaplain of the Caſtle took a conceit, to come and lift the ſtone of the Vault to ſee if the Phyſician had ſpoken truth. They hoped for better fortune, if they could ſave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to a man whom they had ſeen ſo fond of me. About midnight therefore they came ſecretly to lift that ſtone; and ſinding my Coffin placed upon the uppermoſt ſteps of the Entry of the Vault; they aſſiſted me ſo ſeaſonably that they began to find ſigns of life in me. I was taken out from thence, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from my Child which was really dead, and was carried to the Chaplains Houſe; where I had not been half an hour before I opened my eyes, and gave hopes of cure. Next day that good Prieſt found a way to have me car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Caſtle unſeen, and to convey me to the Cottages of ſome Fiſhers that ſtood
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:100358:187"/>upon the Sea ſhore. There he and that poor Country Maid took ſo much care of me, that at the end of ſix weeks I was well and up again. Both of them lent me a little money, that I might take Shipping at <hi>Breſt</hi> to go to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> where I was told the Marqueſs of <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbel</hi> was. The Maid would needs go along with me, and with ſlattering hopes we went both to Sea; but our Ship was overtaken by a violent ſtorm which laſted two days and two nights, and we were forced upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſhore. I will not trouble you with the particular relation of that adventure which you will hardly believe. In ſhort, our Veſſel ſplit againſt the rock of an Iſland, and ſome others beſides us being by extraordinary good fortune caſt upon the ſand were ſaved. Our fortune was ſtill better in that we found there ſome Hollanders who aſſiſted us until that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was pleaſed to ſend thither another Veſſel to carry us back into <hi>France;</hi> for the Inhabitants of that Iſland had none, and had been by Shipwrack thrown upon that place as well as we. You may judge of my grief when I underſtood that for thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Veſſel had arrived there but ours, though that was for our ruine; and when I had all reaſon to believe that I muſt ſpend the reſt of my life with theſe wretches. However I ſtayed but three years there, after which I
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100358:187"/>found an occaſion to come off and to return into <hi>Brettanie.</hi> But upon my return I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Marqueſs of <hi>Kimperbel</hi> was married to another, and that afflicted me more than all my other croſſes. I fell ſick upon it almoſt ſix months in the heart of the Town of <hi>Rennes</hi> it ſelf, where no body imagined that I could be ſtill living. From thence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made my ſelf known to my Lady Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Alimberg;</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhe, you know, is the Author of our friendſhip and intimacy. It was my deſign to betake my ſelf to a Nunnery for the reſt of my life time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering my ſelf or adventures; and I ſhould have proſecuted my intention at our return to <hi>Paris;</hi> but meeting this Evening with him whoſe preſence I avoided in <hi>Bret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> I am ſo diſordered, that I cannot tell if it had not been better for me if they had let me reſt in my Grave.</p>
               <p>With theſe words ſhe ended her relation, and <hi>Maidemoiſelle Velzers</hi> perceived that ſhe wept. Let us ſleep, ſaid ſhe to her, and not afflict our ſelves, and to morrow I'll adviſe you what you ſhall do. Alas! ſaid <hi>Mademoiſelle de Kermas,</hi> I have nothing that I can pretend to do but to throw my ſelf into a Nunnery. Shortly after their diſcourſe ended, or at leaſt for reaſons that I know, I muſt make them conclude here. If any be impatient to learn
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100358:188"/>what became of <hi>Clelia;</hi> they may know that the Company were no ſooner up next day, but that they underſtood that her raviſher was her dear <hi>Aronce,</hi> the young Marqueſs of ..... He was come from <hi>England</hi> to make ſome Compliments of condoling; <hi>Clelia</hi>'s Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was acquainted by a Foot-boy of her Aunts who was privy to all, that he was at <hi>Fountainbleau;</hi> he took notice of her, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, and was pat at the canal to reſcue her out of the water. They ferried over all together, that they might go to the Counteſs of <hi>Pardelles;</hi> but without acquainting the young Ladies Couſin, for ſome certain reaſons which I ſhall declare if I be hard put to it for another tome. Since that time <hi>Cleliae</hi> hath met with many other adventures; for beſides, that the water which ſhe drank in the <hi>Tyber,</hi> had a little cooled the choler which fed her melancholy; the Joy that ſhe felt in finding her dear <hi>Aronce</hi> again, compleated her cure, and they were married. The Ladies <hi>de Kermas, Barbiſieux</hi> and <hi>Velzers,</hi> in time had their contentment alſo; and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men themſelves came to ſee a pleaſant period put to their adventures.</p>
